Code for the ICS5110 Assignment.

## Repository Setup

This guide explains how to set up the project locally or run it using Google Collab.

### Local Setup

#### Assumptions:

Before starting, ensure the following are installed on your machine:

1. Python 3.12 or newer
    - Check your version:
    - Windows/macOS/Linux: `python --version`
    - Or, depending on your configuration: `python3 --version`
2. Git (for version control)
    - Check your installation: `git --version`


#### Steps:

1. Clone the GitHub repository on your local machine.
2. Once the repo is cloned locally, using the CMD, navigate to the project directory.
3. Once inside the project directory, create a virtual environment by running `python -m venv .venv` (or `python3 -m venv .venv`). This should create a `.venv` folder.
4. Activate your virutal environment by running `.venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows) or `source .venv/bin/activate` (Linux).
5. Install python packages required for the project by running `pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r requirements.txt`. This will install the Jupyter package required to work with Jupyter notebooks.
6. Run `jupyter notebook` to activate and launch the Jupyter notebook interface locally.

### Google Collab

If you prefer not to run the project locally, you can use Google Colab.

#### Steps:

1. Open Google Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/
2. In Colab, go to File → Open Notebook → GitHub.
3. Enter the repository URL and load the notebook(s).
4. Run the cells — Colab will handle Python, dependencies, and environment setup.

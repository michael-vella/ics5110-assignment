The Transport Safety Investigative Commission will be tasked to investigate the causes of serious road accidents.  Minister Chris Bonett said on Monday that his ministry was holding talks with the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Home Affairs on the setting up of the bureau. “In the coming weeks, we will present the first ideas on the bureau,” Bonett said when questioned, saying that changes to laws will be required.    At present, magisterial inquiries and police investigations are the only tools available for the investigation of road accidents in Malta. Their findings typically remain confidential, which has drawn criticism from various quarters. Victims’ families, insurers, and medical associations have condemned the delay in establishing the bureau, describing it as symptomatic of road safety being sidelined. During the press conference, Bonett also urged drivers to observe traffic rules and treat one another with respect. “We must ensure that such bureaus and road safety councils are needed as little as possible,” he said.",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/f61d13ee30944b0f143553bbe8adcf0a96a94d68-1736776627-0dd63ba7-1920x1280.jpg,Photo: Matthew Mirabelli,2025-07-03 15:11:54.30228+00,"{Accident,National,Roads,Transport}",2025-01-13 00:00:00,False,,,,,,,,,,2025-01-1300:00:00,nan,nan,nan,True,[3615]

Drivers are getting out of their cars, furious,” one motorist said, describing the chaotic scene. One driver counted at least 12 cars sustaining flat tyres though he was sure others had simply driven on not realising the damage. Despite calls to the authorities to repair the pothole or divert traffic, no action had been taken by 4.30pm, leaving hundreds of drivers to navigate the treacherous road or rely on sheer luck.  A motorist claimed the pothole had been present for weeks, but Friday’s heavy rain worsened the damage, while the flowing water concealed the hazard from drivers.

Speaking in a Times Talk episode that will be released next week, the Transport Minister said that after consulting with classic car enthusiasts he realised he ""may have jumped the gun"" when he announced the measure. ""I admit we were a bit hasty with that measure. I don't mind admitting that, and I don't think it's a sign of weakness to admit a mistake. Rather, it shows you're serious,"" he said. ""I still agree with the measure but I may have jumped the gun when I announced it. We want to protect the hobby of vintage cars while making sure nobody abuses the system."" Currently, cars that are older than 30 years are exempted from annual licence fees and must only pay an annual €8 administrative fee, provided the vehicle does not exceed 3,000 kilometres per year. Vintage vehicles are marked on Maltese roads with a black number plate. But the authorities observed that some drivers were passing off their old cars as 'vintage', managing to pay very low licence fees for a car they use every day and which is not a classic car at all. Moreover, 'hundreds' of old, second-hand vehicles are being imported every year and registered as vintage cars but used as ordinary cars for every day transportation by abusing the loophole in the system. Last week, as part of a raft of measures aimed at tackling Malta's chronic traffic congestion, Bonett announced the government would curb vintage car abuse by introducing a measure that stipulates that vehicles must be 35 years old to qualify for a black number plate and that they will be subject to inspections. But during the filming of Times Talk on Thursday, Bonett told Times of Malta he will amend that measure and that he takes full responsibility for the oversight. ""We're not after people's hobbies,"" he said. ""We only need to make sure that the fees for classic car enthusiasts are not abused by people who want to keep their junk cars on the road."" Later on Thursday the Minister said on Facebook that there was an agreement on the decision following a meeting with the Maltese Vintage Vehicle Federation.  ""The purpose of the meeting was to understand where we want to go as a Government, to remove from our roads ordinary cars that are being used under the guise of being 'vintage' and abusing the system, while protecting those who invest in truly classic cars,"" he wrote. ""We agreed on everything, and in the coming weeks, after the necessary legal work is done, we will announce how the reform, which everyone agrees we need, will work. ""What I can anticipate from now is that we are satisfied that we can achieve our goal without raising the car age requirement from 30 to 35 years. In fact, we will introduce measures that will strengthen this hobby."" Unplanned measures - PN One hour after the Nationalist Party held a press conference in Msida on Thursday criticising the government's proposals, transport minister Chris Bonett admitted he had changed his mind about the vintage car scheme, the Opposition said. In a statement, the PN said this ""further confirmed just how Saturday's anouncement was unplanned and without consultation."" ""Bonett reversed this measure following the pressure made by the Opposition in the last days in parliament and outside,"" the PN said.",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/3959182accfdd068b12ee2aaf6eeb7dd233bd8c6-1743688415-efac259f-1920x1280.png,Times Talk with Chris Bonett will be released next week.

Prime Minister Robert Abela and Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri announced the details of a new law that has been tabled in parliament in the wake of pressure from several professionals following a spate of horrifying road accidents this summer. The proposed changes, which Camilleri said come as police road checks have surged to unprecedented levels, focus on strengthening penalties and introducing new testing methods. If the law is approved, police will be empowered to conduct drug tests on drivers at the roadside, similar to current alcohol checks. Drug and alcohol tests can be performed on drivers even without reasonable suspicion. Moreover, anyone who causes a person's death while under the influence of alcohol or drugs will face a mandatory prison sentence, eliminating the option of a suspended sentence. And fines for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs will be increased. Police will also be able to request the immediate suspension of a driver's license while court proceedings are pending. At present motorists are only tested after accidents or when there is 'reasonable suspicion' that they may be driving under the influence.  Emergency doctor Jonathan Joslin on Sunday reiterated his call for random testing of motorists for alcohol and drugs, saying it is the true deterrent in decreasing injury and death.

By deterring dangerous behaviours such as drink and drug driving, it ensures greater accountability among drivers and creates a stronger culture of responsibility on our roads,” Joslin said.  Joslin was at the forefront insisting that random testing would be a more effective deterrent to prevent serious traffic accidents than the reactive imposition of higher penalties to those who cause such crashes. His comments come after Prime Minister Robert Abela and Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri announced the proposed changes, in the wake of pressure from several professionals and lobby groups following a spate of horrifying road accidents this summer.  They will be incorporated into a bill tabled in parliament last June, titled Traffic Regulation Ordinance (Amendment) Bill, which will be debated once parliament resumes in September. Only the bill's title was tabled at the time.  If the bill is approved, police will be empowered to conduct drug tests on drivers at the roadside, similar to current alcohol checks. Fines for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs will also be increased.  Moreover, anyone who causes a person's death while under the influence of alcohol or drugs will face a mandatory prison sentence, eliminating the option of a suspended sentence. Along with Joslin, the Insurance Association Malta also welcomed the government's move to introduce harsher penalties for drunk and drugged driving. The IAM said it has been actively lobbying for such measures over recent years, as it firmly believes tougher enforcement will serve as a much-needed deterrent against irresponsible and dangerous conduct on the roads. “These measures send a clear signal to all that protecting the lives of responsible, law-abiding road users is paramount,” IAM director General Adrian Galea said.

Mġiebaħ Bay, in Mellieħa’s Selmun area, is a swimming spot favoured by those wanting to avoid crowds. Pictures posted on social media and others taken by Times of Malta show deep cracks in rock formations just above a flat, clay part of Mġiebaħ that is popular with bathers.  Frenki Dragan Crnjakovic, who flagged the issue on the Facebook group ‘The BEST of Malta’, said he highlighted the issue last year. “A huge chunk of rock is waiting for its moment to crash into the sea. I wrote about this last year but it seems my post didn’t reach many people. Be kind – share with your friends. I believe that it will also reach the official services that will mark or fence off these dangerous areas,” he said.  Mellieħa mayor Gabriel Micallef said he first reported the issue to the police and several government entities last April. He pointed to a particular rock formation that seemed close to dislodging onto the crowd. By May, a report commissioned by the police and drawn up by the Public Works Department’s Project Design and Engineering Directorate confirmed the danger. “It has been observed that large boulders are gradually becoming dislodged due to ongoing coastal erosion,” the report, dated May 9, says. “This natural process is giving rise to areas that pose a significant risk to public safety, especially as the summer season approaches and the bay is expected to attract a high number of visitors for sunbathing and swimming,” it says. The report said that, besides the cracks in the rock formation highlighted by Micallef, other rock formations in other parts of the bay were dangerous. “In view of the above, I strongly recommend that a qualified geotechnical engineer be urgently commissioned to carry out a comprehensive assessment of the site. The objective of this evaluation should be to identify zones of potential danger and advise on any necessary mitigation measures,” the report says. “Given the imminent increase in public use of this location, this assessment should be undertaken as soon as possible to prevent any avoidable incidents.” Correspondence provided to Times of Malta by the Mellieħa mayor shows that the Lands Authority was alerted to the problem. Micallef said that the last communication he had from the authority was in June, when the Lands Authority and the council agreed to install danger signs. “Kindly note that danger signs have been ordered and I will update you with the date of installation,” the e-mail, dated June 24, said. Questions have been sent to the lands ministry. Last year, 22-year-old Mirabelle Falzon died when she was hit by falling rocks at a popular spot in an area known as Munxar, in the limits of St Thomas Bay. The ruins of an 18th-century military battery, known as Riħama, are perched on the cliff overlooking the site. After the incident, several signs were put up, warning that swimming in the area is prohibited, and a fence was erected around the battery itself.  A magisterial inquiry into the tragedy said reports about the dangerous state of the coastal battery in Marsascala, made in the months and years before the collapse killed Falzon, were lost in the bureaucracy of government entities.  The magistrate recommended that a single entity should be responsible for receiving reports about state-owned and private buildings, as well as abandoned buildings and structures like bastions and cliffs that presented a danger to the public. In a statement reacting to the conclusions, the government said it will be implementing the court’s recommendation for there to be one entity “that will receive reports about government buildings or private buildings, as well as about walls, cliffs, or abandoned buildings that pose a danger to the public”.",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/0191d72a735c9d4c5aab804d2c674bdd585860ae-1757481590-792c9e79-1920x1280.jpg,The site at risk of a potentially deadly rockfall.

Motorists reported spending more than double the usual time on their commutes on Tuesday, and many took to social media to express frustration, complaining about standstill traffic that stretched even onto non-arterial roads. In a Facebook post, Transport Malta said there were 23 collisions, 10 vehicle breakdowns and two separate spillages across the island on Tuesday. It said calls for assistance were more numerous than other days, and its officers were much busier trying to solve the gridlocks. And those are just the cases Transport Malta assisted in, and do not include accidents that were reported to LESA. However, it is unclear whether the traffic jams were linked to the high number of accidents.  Transport Malta constantly monitors the roads using scores of cameras scattered around the island, and it employs officers on foot, motorbikes and in cars to patrol and clear the roads whenever accidents occur. To ensure roads are cleared as quickly as possible, officers - and sometimes whole units - are immediately deployed to the scene of a crash or breakdown, or when heavy vehicles spill hazardous fluids, materials, or chemicals. Traffic frustration On Tuesday, several motorists on social media said a journey from Sliema to Marsa took up to 1.5 hours, the short hop from Ta' Xbiex to Msida was an hour-long ordeal, the route from San Ġwann to Msida lasted 45 minutes, and drivers travelling from the Three Cities to Attard spent 1.5 hours stuck in traffic.  Key hotspots throughout the day included the St. Paul’s Bay bypass, with heavy congestion along the Coast Road and in St Julian's. Furthermore, traffic was especially bad in Paola, Marsa's Aldo Moro Road, the Marsa/Ħamrun bypass and Regional Road. Major traffic was also reported on most roads leading in and out of the Gżira, Ta’ Xbiex, and Msida area, with vehicles barely moving. Parliament drama The day's traffic woes even spilled into an impromptu banter session in parliament later that day between Prime Minister Robert Abela and Opposition Leader Alex Borg. The drama began when government whip Naomi Cachia accused the opposition of raising a procedural issue simply to buy time for Borg to arrive, as he was running late. Borg eventually arrived mid-way through Abela’s speech. When he took the floor, he told the Prime Minister he was delayed because, unlike Abela, he was stuck in traffic as he doesn't have an escort. Abela quickly hit back, telling Borg he ""better had his licence and insurance paid"". This was a reference to a recent incident involving Borg's partner, Sarah Bajada, who was caught driving without a valid vehicle licence and insurance.",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/943b89ef823623cc61d972d5d1d3f97d74b4aead-1759934255-d5adee8a-1920x1280.png,Traffic was especially bad on Tuesday.

Transport Malta said it ""was not informed about the works, and the contractor did not hold a valid permit to carry out works at the site where the accident occurred.""  Similarly, Infrastructure Malta said it ""had not been notified about the works, and no permission was requested for them."" However, it acknowledged that the accident occurred near works being carried out by a private contractor under its administration. It did not name the contractor involved. In October, Infrastructure Malta began work to replace a dangerous leaning wall along the same bypass section where the accident happened. St Paul’s Bay Mayor, Censu Galea, also confirmed that the council had not issued any permits. ""No permits were ever issued as far as I am informed,"" he said. He said he was told the skip was placed on the road at around 1pm on Wednesday. The incident was reported to the police at around 5pm.  The mayor noted that the same skip had been in the same location two to three months ago, and people raised safety concerns with the council at the time. He explained that once he was informed, the council alerted Infrastructure Malta, which added cones and bollards at that time. The skip involved in Wednesday’s accident was left at the final curve leading to the Xemxija roundabout. According to the police, the injured motorcyclist, an English man from Mellieħa, lost control of his Honda and collided with the skip. He remains in Mater Dei Hospital with serious injuries.

Friends and acquaintances have remembered Vink as a warm and principled man who left an indelible mark on their lives but there is palpable anger over whether the tragedy could have been prevented.  Fleur Marie Cilia Buckett, who had been friends with Vink for 17 years, described the victim as ""an amazing man"" who stood by her in her darkest hours. In return, she stayed by his side in the hours following his tragic crash. “He was a man full of morals, good Yorkshire stock, and an animal lover to his core,” she said. Buckett recalled how they met on the social platform Hi5, where Vink adopted his beloved cats, Xemx and Bomba, who are now in need of a new home. Buckett expressed her devastation upon learning of his accident from a Times of Malta online report. “My heart stopped, and I howled in disbelief. He was so careful - that could have easily been any of us.” Determined to honour her friend’s memory, Buckett is organising a bike ride in his name on December 28, starting at Mater Dei Hospital and ending at Xemxija Pitstop, where donations will be collected to help pay for his cremation and lawyers' fees. They will also set up a GoFundMe page for the above.  “I can assure you I will fight tooth and nail till justice is served,” she added.  Dorian Sid Turner, a fellow motorcyclist and a friend of Vink for 10 years, echoed these sentiments. “The world lost a true gentleman,” he said, reminiscing about how Vink, a freelance hairdresser, would cut his and his son’s hair. “He was such a good listener. Even if I was having a bad day, somehow he could make me smile,” Turner added. Speaking on behalf of the biking community, he vowed that Vink’s death would not be in vain. “We will not rest until justice is served,” Turner said. Vink, who lived in Malta since the 1990s, originally hailed from Yorkshire, England. After training as a hairdresser, he later became a customer service specialist. For the past five years, he was a familiar face at the Xemxija Pitstop, where owner Vickie Cutajar described him as “a true gentleman” and “a very good client.” “Dieter was warm and friendly,” Cutajar said, adding that customers recognised him immediately from news reporting the accident because of his motorcycle. She shared how Vink would often stop by on his way to work for his usual Americano and toast, a routine the staff will deeply miss. The police confirmed that Vink was riding his Honda motorcycle on Wednesday evening when he collided with the skip. Although emergency responders took him to Mater Dei Hospital, he succumbed to his injuries on Friday. Transport Malta, Infrastructure Malta, and the St Paul’s Bay local council have denied issuing any permit for the skip to be placed in the busy thoroughfare. The skip is believed to have been placed by a contractor working on a boundary wall. St Paul’s Bay mayor Censu Galea said that residents had previously raised safety concerns about the skip, which had been placed at the same location months earlier.",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/d7d95259da8154497e2e91360135bd2d0f133d17-1734181299-d2b16487-1920x1280.jpeg,Cilia Buckett and Vink Photo: Cilia Buckett's Facebook,2025-07-03 15:13:44.081826+00,"{Accident,Motoring,National,""St Paul’S Bay""}",{},1,,11/12/2024,11/12/2024 0:00,Medium,0,72,Night (00:00-06:00),no,no,no

In a statement on Monday evening, TM said it had “suspended any future permits for this contractor until all safety standards are assured,” while confirming the contractor had “illegally” resumed works last week without a valid permit or informing the agency. “These works had been stopped for months, and any resumption without proper authorisation is entirely the responsibility of the contractor,” it said. Dieter Vink, 54, was riding a Honda motorcycle on Wednesday evening when he smashed into the stationery garbage skip placed on the bypass' final curve leading to the Xemxija roundabout. The collision left Vink in a critical condition and he was taken to Mater Dei Hospital for treatment, there succumbing to his injuries on Friday night. Footage of the incident generated an outpouring of grief and anger, with many calling for accountability over what they claimed as negligence on the part of the contractor. Times of Malta has been informed by multiple sources that the contractor in question is JV Infrastructure. Repeated attempts to contact the company were unsuccessful. Vink’s family have said they “want justice, and we will not let him pass in vain,” and have demanded accountability for the events that led to the popular hairdresser’s death. Speaking to Times of Malta less than 24 hours after his death, the family said Vink had suffered catastrophic brain trauma in the accident, with other injuries including a broken right arm, several fractured ribs, a punctured liver and spleen, two black eyes and cuts and bruises all over his body. Fleur Marie Cilia Buckett said the crash helmet the motorcyclist was wearing at the time of the crash looked like “corn flakes,” while stressing Vink was a careful rider. “That could have easily been any of us,” she said.

Dieter Vink, 54, died last Friday, two days after crashing his motorcycle into a skip positioned on the final curve of the St Paul’s Bay bypass before the Xemxija roundabout.  “I’m sick of going to funerals. It feels like our lives are cheap,” Galea said, mentioning the deaths of Johanna Boni, after being hit by a truck in 2015, and Marie Claire Lombardi, who lost control of her bike after it skidded on olives spilled onto the road in 2022. Speaking about the experience of riding a motorcycle more generally, Galea said it had become more dangerous to drive on Malta’s roads over the past four or five years. “I think it’s because drivers are frustrated by the ever-increasing traffic, which in turn leads them to drive in an impatient and careless manner. Right now, the situation feels like it’s beyond repair,” he said. Aldo Overend, a committee member of the NGO, echoed Galea’s sentiments.  “We just hope this accident will lead to action because we can’t go on like this,"" he said. ""While riding, I feel like I constantly have to dodge heavy vehicles, construction materials, fresh concrete and water leaking from bowsers, as well as reckless car drivers not taking us into account."" Official data shows almost 40 per cent of all road traffic casualties involve motorcyclists.  Vink’s family and friends have vowed to get justice for his death and are seeking legal advice. A GoFundMe page has been set up to raise funds to cover funeral and legal expenses, along with a fundraising bike ride planned for December 28, starting at Mater Dei Hospital and ending at Vink’s second home, The Pitstop in Xemxija.",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/8631579747f763429366baba4e9136dd24ab0494-1734433065-b7643960-1920x1280.png,"Victims of motorcycle crashes in recent years, from left, Johanna Boni, Dieter Vink and Marie Claire Lombardi.

Fiona Laferla’s son, Ben, was a passenger in a rental car driven by his friend, Maxime Asacha Muehlematter, when it crashed into a wall on Triq il-Madliena in Swieqi. Last month, Muehlematter received a suspended jail sentence and a one-year driving ban after admitting to involuntarily causing Ben’s death on September 24, 2022. Maltese traffic regulations stipulate a minimum driving ban of six months to a year, with courts having discretion over the final length based on the specific circumstances.  Lingering questions In court, it emerged that the front seatbelts were elongated but those at the back were stiff, indicating Ben and Flo had not been wearing them. After the crash, first aiders found Ben outside the car. A passer-by pulled him out to try to help. Max’s 17-year-old girlfriend initially claimed she was driving. She later admitted she lied, thinking her age would protect her from charges. She received a conditional discharge. A bottle of rum and another bottle of alcohol was found in the car, leading to public assumptions about the group’s behaviour. Fiona derides the “callous comments” and clarifies that Ben had had the bottle of rum for weeks. Fiona remains unconvinced about the reported speed of 35km/hr, noting that Ben’s injuries seemed too severe. “You know how many times my sister and I tried taking a sudden break at that speed to try to understand? I know that stupid things happen. In this case, there was a wall. But there are still questions.” The mother says the car safety element was never explored during the court case. “There is always a fault – but there are other things to consider that go beyond the driver: is the car properly maintained? Is the road too dark?” Fiona was hoping the court case would give her the answers. It did not, and she found it painful when a defence lawyer attempted to discredit Ben and Flo, even though they were sitting at the back. In the end, following a change of lawyer, Max admitted to causing Ben’s death. The prosecution withdrew charges relating to reckless and negligent driving as well as driving under the influence, because there was no material evidence that could lead to a conviction. “I wasn’t hoping Max goes to prison because I wasn’t out for vengeance. I don’t want to persecute the boy. Ben loved him. He was his friend. That was meant to be down the road and coming back. You don’t think it’s going to happen to you… Just because Ben is not here doesn’t mean Max cannot have a life.” And now, Fiona says, her mission is to keep Ben’s memory alive. One way of doing it by promoting a ‘Ben Lafesta’ charity event, among other events in the pipeline. “That keeps me going,” she says.",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/f2ffc5418e071788e7931a93e11b5f9f5006033f-1735450014-545e0152-1920x1280.jpg,A police picture of the scene of the accident in Swieqi.

Emanuel Gatt was targeted by criminal charges following the accident which took place in Triq il-Mithna, Qormi on December 17, 2006 when he was involved in a collision which resulted in grievous injuries to a woman in the other car. Gatt was subsequently prosecuted for careless and dangerous driving, driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, having an alcohol level beyond the legal limits as well as causing grievous injuries to the woman. The proceedings dragged on until earlier this year, when the case was assigned to a new magistrate. Eighteen years down the line, Gatt registered an admission to three of the charges, including that related to the injuries involuntarily caused to the victim. When examining the evidence to determine whether Gatt was guilty of the other charges the court, presided over by Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech, observed that the only witness who testified in the proceedings was a medical doctor who confirmed that the victim fractured a left-hand finger. She also suffered neck and shoulder injuries. The injuries were classified as grievous because of the fracture Despite the fact that the doctor was the only witness, the proceedings dragged on for 17 years. A court minute dated March 28, 2008 indicated that the driver of the other car had claimed damages to the tune of €1700. That amount included court expenses. But what was most concerning was the fact that his name was not even mentioned in that court minute. Much less so did he testify, observed the magistrate when delivering judgment. Nor was there any receipt or a single scrap of documentary evidence to support his claim for damages. Yet, while the case dragged on, the accused made €300 payments to someone named Etienne Bugeja. He appeared to be a relative of the victim and was driving the car at the time of the crash. That fact was understood through the police current incident report which, however, was never confirmed on oath. The magistrate was “most astonished” by the fact that the court, as previously presided, had permitted such payments for damages allegedly caused to Bugeja’s car when the accused was never charged with causing damage to third party property but only for injuring the passenger. And although he claimed damages totalling €1700, Bugeja was never even formally identified in the court records. In light of such evidence and the circumstances of the case, the court cleared Gatt of the other charges whilst conditionally discharging him for 40 months over those charges he pleaded guilty to. When meting out punishment, the court took into consideration Gatt’s criminal record and the fact that the case had “inexplicably” dragged on for 17 years. The court also imposed a three-month driving ban.",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/8bbd28c39f3098e6a20e2545605ab75983c416b5-1735556568-5ed4ea19-1920x1280.jpg,"Eighteen years after a traffic accident, a motorist has been banned from driving for three months.",2025-07-03 15:12:45.82801+00,"{Court,National,Traffic}",{},1,,30/12/2024,30/12/2024 0:00,Low,0,0,Night (00:00-06:00),no,no,yes

I worry that eventually, everyone becomes immune to these deaths until it impacts them,” she said.  “The worst thing that can strike you is indifference, and that is why I don’t understand the policymakers.”  She was also critical of the cold approach relatives are faced with when finding themselves in the court system.  “I saw this indifference first-hand in court with the first lawyer that (the driver of the car) had,” she continued.  “I’m a generally calm person but there was one occasion where I wanted to throw something at him. He tried to ridicule me, tried to paint Ben and his girlfriend in the worst light possible and was bringing up things that had nothing to do with the case at all.” Last year Maxime Asacha Muehlematter, the 22-year-old who was driving the car that Ben died in, admitted to causing his death and was handed a suspended sentence and a one-year driving ban. Muehlematter was cleared of drink-driving charges as prosecutors had no evidence to prove that charge. Initially another passenger in the car, a girl who was 17 at the time, told police she was the one driving the car.  The girl later admitted she had lied and that Muehlematter was the driver. She was given a conditional discharge.    Laferla told Times of Malta last year that while she was not out for revenge and did not want to see the young man go to prison, she felt that he should have received a longer driving ban, if barring him from driving forever was not a possibility.  Bringing this point up again on Saturday, she said that these are the issues policymakers should be addressing, particularly as road deaths are not isolated incidents and continue to claim people’s lives senselessly year after year.  “I knew that it was going to be a slap on the wrist because I had seen what happened in other cases,” she said.  “We were lucky that he admitted and the process was not long and drawn out. But when you’ve already lost your son that’s not saying much. Don’t the people on top see these things?” she questioned.",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/9858e24c8f56c2e97deba926a8af856e4103651b-1736603827-00d54474-1920x1280.png,Fiona Laferla.

3588,https://timesofmalta.com/article/danish-father-left-dark-son-killed-car-accident.1103735,Times of Malta,https://timesofmalta.com,Danish father ‘left in the dark’ about son killed in car accident,Asger Emil Neidhardt's family are questioning whether anything has happened a year since he died,Giulia Magri,16/01/2025,"The father of a Danish man who died after being hit by a car in St Julian’s a year and a half ago has been left in the dark as to what happened the night his son died. Asger Emil Neidhardt, a 25-year-old IT entrepreneur, arrived in Malta on October 22, 2023, for a holiday with friends. Six days later, he died after he was hit by a Honda Accord driven by a 44-year-old man in the Regional Road tunnels. While a police spokesperson said the family had been provided with updates on the investigation and the ongoing magisterial inquiry, Neidhardt’s father disputed this claim. “Ten days after the accident, my son arrived in Denmark in a coffin, and we never heard from the Maltese authorities about what happened to him,” Lars Neidhardt told Times of Malta. “It’s very frustrating to lose one’s child and not know what happened. Is the case being investigated? Is the driver facing any consequences? We are completely left in the dark.” While details of the accident are scarce, Neidhardt was in touch with the friends who were the last to see Asger. That night the group had gone out, yet Asger did not return to his accommodation with the others. “His friends called and texted him during the night, but he never answered,” he said. The next morning, the group headed to the police station to report their missing friend. There, a police officer informed them about the accident and asked them to identify the body. They confirmed it was Asger. Later in the day, Asger’s mother received a call from the Maltese police informing her that her son was killed in a car accident. Neidhardt then found online media reports about his son’s death. “One minute he is out for dinner and drinks, and then the next thing I find out is that my son is dead,” Neidhardt said. Ten days later, Asger’s body arrived in Denmark. His father recalled how more than 300 people attended his funeral in Aabenraa, the town where he grew up. Countless calls and emails Following the funeral, the family contacted the Danish Embassy (based in Rome) to see how they could get more information on what happened to Asger. The ambassador advised them to contact the attorney general. Since Asger’s death, his father has sent eight emails to the attorney general and made countless phone calls, only to receive the same response each time: the magisterial inquiry has not yet been concluded. “It is now more than one year since my son died in Malta, and I still haven’t heard one word from the authorities in Malta,” Neidhardt wrote in his last email to the attorney general on December 6, 2024. “Please be informed that the inquiry is not yet concluded,” was the response he received. Neidhardt has started to question if anything has happened since the accident. “I am never informed how long I have to wait for an update or if the case is still under investigation. Nothing.”  In a reply to questions regarding the magisterial inquiry, a police spokesperson said while the inquiry is still ongoing the family have been updated on the investigations. “While the investigating officer communicates with the family since the victim’s family resides abroad, they have been updated about the investigations and the inquiry through the Danish Consulate,” the spokesperson said. Neidhardt confirmed the family were never in touch with the authorities, nor did the Consulate reach out to them. “We have heard absolutely nothing.” ‘Spread joy because of his positive attitude’ Neidhardt recalled how his son loved life and enjoyed travelling around Europe with friends for new experiences. “He was a very caring, loving and funny young man, he loved his family and friends above all,” he said. “He spread joy in the family and his surroundings because of his positive attitude and energy.” The last time Lars saw his son was two weeks before he died, during a family weekend trip at a summer house. “I hugged him in the driveway before he drove off back home. I still can’t believe that I will never see him again.” This is not the first time that family members have raised questions about Maltese authorities following an incident. In 2016, Mike Mansholt, a 17-year-old who came to Malta on holiday, was found dead at the foot of Dingli Cliffs. The Maltese magisterial inquiry concluded that Mike had died of natural causes and police closed the case. While the Maltese and German post-mortem concluded that the teenager had no broken bones, the Medical University of Hanover uncovered that Mike was devoid of the heart, brain, neck organs, lungs, liver, pancreas, adrenal glands, right kidney, bladder, stomach and the small intestine. His backpack, along with his phone and GoPro camera, were never found. In 2021, Mansholt’s father asked the German courts to order the Maltese authorities to reopen investigations into his son’s mysterious death.",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/78ec7684bdd2834ad6ec891c05117b3cb9c606dc-1736962969-69fd6ef4-1920x1280.jpg,"Asger Emil Neidhardt, a 25-year-old IT entrepreneur, arrived in Malta on October 22, 2023 for a holiday with friends.

Following a magisterial inquiry into the case, several people had been charged over the incident. These were MFCC directors Chris Vassallo, Nazzareno Vassallo and Gerald Borg, CEO Anita Mifsud and projects manager Mark Anthony Farrugia.  They pleaded not guilty to involuntarily causing serious injuries to worker Emanuel Ronayne through their negligence. They were also charged with involuntarily causing slight injuries to other workers, causing damages to Nexos Ltd and RVC Ltd and breaching the Occupational Health and Safety Act.  Magistrate Caroline Farrugia Frendo heard how, on the day, workers were fixing lighting and other cables onto a metal arch ahead of the rock concert. The metal arch collapsed. Ronayne was passing some cables when it happened and he felt a “sudden massive blow” that resulted in him suffering from perforated lungs, a ruptured spleen, fractured ribs on his left side as well as fractures to several vertebrae.  The magistrate heard several witnesses testify how the arch had been put in place in 2006. It was used to affix lighting and screens and could be moved around depending on the needs of the event being organised. It moved on wheels that ran on rails and had to be dragged with fork lifters. The same procedure of moving the arch had been used since it was set up. A couple of days before the incident the arch had been moved according to the needs of the rock concert. Usually, lighting was then fixed according to an approved plan agreed on by Nexos, RVC and MFCC and under the supervision of an architect. In this case, the approved plan had not yet been supplied and the architect had not been appointed to supervise the works. The magistrate ruled that, although responsible for the company, this did not mean that the accused were criminally responsible for anything that happened there. She also noted that, according to court expert Alex Torpiano, the collapse was the result of three factors: the unbalanced loading of the arch, the way the arch was moved, and the contact between the arch’s wheels and the concrete floor. It was not clear if one or all of these factors had caused the accident. Since the exact cause of the accident could not be pinned down, the court could not attribute blame to the directors of the MFCC or any of its workers. Lawyer Joe Giglio represented the Vassallos, Borg and Mifsud while lawyer Patrick Valentino appeared for Farrugia.",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/0757dd01455e192e9adca6530be05becee258e5e-1737541280-e07e1846-1920x1280.png,A metal arch had collapsed onto a worker at the MFCC in 2014.

They told us he had, in fact, died,” Sciberras, then a young woman in her early twenties, recalled. “I will never forget the scene I saw that day. His body was not in one piece.” Angelo was one of nine dockyard workers killed in a powerful explosion at the then state-owned Malta Drydocks 30 years ago – a tragedy that will remain one of the darkest chapters in Malta’s industrial history and one of the worst workplace tragedies since the war.  But for Sciberras, Seguna and the relatives of those who perished, the pain remains raw even after three decades. Following the inquiry, the structurally damaged Um El Faroud was deemed a total loss and the decision was made to scuttle the ship off the southern coast as an artificial reef and diving attraction. Today, the wreck serves as a popular destination for divers, while a memorial plaque on the ship pays tribute to the nine workers who lost their lives.

Asger Emil Neidhardt, a 25-year-old IT entrepreneur, died on October 28, 2023, after he was hit by a Honda Accord driven by a 44-year-old man at the entrance of the Regional Road tunnels. His father, Lars Neidhardt, contacted Times of Malta three weeks ago to express his frustration after his requests for information about the fatal accident went ignored by the Maltese authorities. He described how he was stonewalled by the police and the attorney general as he tried to get information on the progress of any investigation into the death. The Maltese police informed Neidhardt last Friday that the magisterial inquiry into his son’s death had been concluded and that the driver would be charged in court. “I am glad that we finally received some information about what happened,” Neidhardt told Times of Malta. He said it might be a “strange coincidence” how the police reached out to him following a push by Times of Malta and the Danish media outlet TV2, yet, is relieved he finally received information. “This is the first proper and real information we received from Malta about my son,” he said. An e-mail sent by a member of the police victim support unit gives details on how investigations were concluded “some weeks ago” and the inquiry report by the magistrate had also been concluded.  “The driver of the vehicle was detained on site and tested negative for alcohol,” the e-mail reads. The e-mail states that charges against the driver have been issued and the police are awaiting a date for the first court hearing. No details were provided on when the driver will be arraigned or the exact charges he will face. However, Neidhardt has been assured he will be kept informed as next of kin. In a reply to questions, a police spokesperson confirmed police investigations and the magisterial inquiry have been concluded. While Neidhardt said recounting the death of his son was “very hard”, he was pleased he did, as it finally gave him answers.  “Going over all the e-mails from the attorney general, looking up pictures of Asger and having to recount his death has been very hard,” he said. “Reliving the past was difficult but I am glad I did it and finally received some information.”",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/5b6f1e828dc4703ac4491e2c12d4a6f35e9de7d4-1738607316-f770336c-1920x1280.jpg,"Lars Neidhardt and his late son Asger Emil Neidhardt, who died when he was hit by a car in 2023.

But this is Malta’: crash victim parents in the dark,Dieter Vink was killed in a horror crash with an unpermitted skip,Emma Borg,16/02/2025,"The parents of a motorcyclist killed in a horror crash with an unpermitted skip say they have been left in the dark, with the authorities failing to provide updates or press charges two months later.  Anthony Holmes, 80, and his wife, Patricia, 79, spoke to Times of Malta from the home of their late son, Dieter Vink, where they were still sorting their son’s belongings. “No one has been in touch at all,” said Vink’s mother, noting there had been complete silence from the authorities since her husband and their son’s close friend, Juliette Johnson, collected his personal items. “We are extremely disappointed that things haven’t moved on,” she added.  Anthony Holmes went further: “It is more than disappointing. We are utterly disgusted. But I learnt this is Malta.” , police would have been on this like white on rice and probably would have charged whoever is responsible by now,” said Vink’s father.  The couple, originally from Yorkshire, England, said that such obstacles in a UK street would have seen half a mile of cones and warning lights to divert traffic.  “There was nothing for our son to see. It is too relaxed in Malta, and it feels like health and safety doesn’t exist here,” he added. Footage of the crash’s aftermath sparked widespread anger on social media, with many calling for accountability, citing alleged negligence by the contractor. Multiple sources informed Times of Malta that JV Infrastructure was responsible for the skip, but repeated attempts to contact the company were unsuccessful. 'I don’t even want to get out of bed' A magisterial inquiry is ongoing, but the lack of communication and updates has deeply affected Vink’s family and friends.  Clutching a locket containing a strand of her son’s hair, his mother admitted: “I don’t even want to get out of bed most days anymore.” She recalled her fond memories of Malta, where she lived as a child while her father worked with the Royal Air Force. For decades, the couple had vacationed here yearly, often staying up to 90 days post-Brexit. What was once a “home away from home” has changed forever.  “At first, I swore I would never return, but his ashes are here, and I want to maintain a connection to him in some way,” Patricia Holmes said.  As they prepare to return to the UK, Vink’s parents are already planning their return in a few months for a vigil in their son’s honour and hope to plant freesias in the small park near his home. “Like that, we can sit and talk to him,” his mother said. For now, they believe these small acts offer a semblance of closure. But, they stress, it is far from enough and demand justice for their son.",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/770a3df340899b6ba1a8b20d001e1b63dc487f3a-1739637073-db572df5-1920x1280.jpg,Vink died after crashing into an unpermitted skip positioned on the final curve of the bypass leading to the Xemxija roundabout..

Andre Spiteri suffered broken ribs, punctured lungs, a broken wrist and a dislocated shoulder when his motorcycle was hit by a van shortly after 11pm on Monday night. The crash happened on Triq il-Kappillan Mifsud, police said. The 23-year-old is recovering from his ordeal at Mater Dei hospital but the driver who fled the scene remains at large. Appealing for information, the Tarxien Rainbows goalkeeper said he doesn’t know how he survived the crash.  Spiteri next remembers lying down on the ground and struggling to breathe. “I couldn’t breathe, it was like someone was trying to choke me, and the pain started immediately,” he said. “I could see that my wrist was broken, and I tried to lift my head and the visor slightly, but I didn’t remove my helmet.” He recalled how a Syrian man rushed to his side and held his hand, while a woman who lives close by and heard the accident also stayed by his side. “They both never left my side, and the woman stayed asking me questions to see what I remembered and how I was feeling,” he said. His parents and girlfriend were in shock when they learned about the accident and are determined to get justice for him. From debris left on the scene, the van appears to be a Citroen Berlingo.

The accident happened on Triq Buqana in Rabat at around 10am. The spillage caused both carriageways of the main road leading to Mġarr to be closed to traffic. The driver of the DAC truck - a 35-year-old man from Marsascala - was taken to hospital by ambulance.  In a Facebook post, Transport Malta announced it had closed the road in both directions until the vehicle and the sand were cleared away.  ROTA urges segregation of high-speed traffic, bicycles  In a statement on Friday afternoon, bicycle advocacy group ROTA said the crash flagged the urgent need for better road safety measures, particularly for bicycle users. The truck, the NGO said, ended up within the bicycle lane, where, had there been a bicycle user, they could have been fatally injured. ""The current road design offers no protection for cyclists, and this tragic event highlights the pressing need for proper segregation between high-speed traffic and vulnerable road users, particularly those on bicycles,"" ROTA said. The need for protected bicycle lanes is not just a local issue - the matter has also been flagged in international road safety guidelines such as the CROW guidelines. These guidelines emphasise the importance of segregation in high-speed areas and the need for roads that are forgiving of human error, the group noted. ""In simple terms, we must ensure that the consequences of mistakes – whether made by a driver or a cyclist – are not fatal. Sadly, Malta is still without a legally binding national cycling policy that will outline clear standards for the design and implementation of safe and effective bicycle lanes. ""We cannot allow cyclists to be subjected to what is, at best, a makeshift effort that often amounts to nothing more than a splash of green paint and some rumble strips. It is not enough. Bicycle lanes need to be designed to protect cyclists – physically separated from traffic in high-speed areas, with sufficient space and barriers to prevent accidents.""",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/e1a151bcbb03544ea8731d738198b7c5456e6ef0-1741945886-550d5246-1920x1280.jpeg,Construction sand spills on to the road.,2025-07-03 15:06:49.726435+00,"{Accident,National,Rabat}",{},1,10am,14/03/2025,14/03/2025 10:00,High,0,0,Morning (06:00-12:00),no,no,yes

St Paul’s Bay resident Godfrey Gambin was charged with the involuntary homicide of Jane Mary Turner, 45. He was also accused of causing involuntary bodily harm on another driver, causing damages to the other car and violating traffic rules. Police sergeant Denise Camilleri told the court that she was stationed at Mosta Police Station on August 20 2017 when she got the call about a collision on Triq Sir Temi Zammit in Mġarr. The sergeant went on site and found Gambin’s car had overturned, the driver was standing outside and had blood over him. Turner, who was inside Gambin’s car, died on site. The other vehicle was on the pavement in the opposite direction. Gambin was hospitalised and was in intensive care for some time. The other driver told the court that he was going to Għadira and was driving towards Mġarr when he saw an oncoming car coming in the opposite direction in his lane. He had no time to avoid the collision and Gambin crashed his vehicle into the man’s car.  The vehicle spun twice before ending up on the pavement. The windscreen shattered. The driver recalled that when he got out of his car, he found Gambin’s car overturned and the female passenger dead on site. The court, presided over by magistrate Caroline Farrugia Frendo, found Gambin guilty and jailed him for four years. He was fined €11,600 and his driving licence was suspended for three months as from 2 April 2025. Gambin was also ordered to pay €2,975.91 in court expenses.

The first collapse happened in Qawra in the early hours of Monday morning, just two hours after the owner of a popular bar on Imrejkba Street had called last orders and closed for the night.  The balcony of the third-floor apartment fell onto the second-floor apartment’s balcony, causing both to crash down onto the bar’s terrace below. Two days later, a stone balcony in Żabbar collapsed onto the pavement below. No one was injured in either incident. The block where the Qawra collapse occurred is located next door to a construction site where 39 apartments and 33 garages are being developed. Following the collapse, the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) issued a stop works notice for the site. However, the notice was reversed soon after and works were allowed to continue. On Thursday, the BCA confirmed that after a professional assessment, it had deemed that work on the site was not responsible for the collapse of the balconies.  The architect said regular inspections were part of a wider overhaul of the regulatory processes and standards involved in the building and construction industry that the chamber had been working on. Point 10 of these proposals calls for “post-occupancy checks and audits to be undertaken as pre-determined by the Building and Construction Authority to ensure the continued compliance of the structure with building regulations”. Such checks, Pizzuto said, could also include compliance with fire safety regulations, as well as the electrical wiring and lifts of a property. “How often these checks occur, and whether they are also carried out on existing buildings is something the government would have to decide on. Ultimately, it has to weigh the cost of carrying out such inspections against the risk of further collapses,” he said, adding that disused buildings and those located near the sea should be checked even more frequently.",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/01a4361c1d9a9464ec6cfbff9a0bbf74c908b960-1743439651-32749ebd-1920x1280.jpg,"Debris in High Street, Sliema, after a balcony collapsed in 2021.

894,https://timesofmalta.com/article/share-first-think-later-when-citizen-journalism-crosses-ethical-lines.1110487,Times of Malta,https://timesofmalta.com,"Share first, think later: When 'citizen journalism' crosses ethical lines",Graphic images of tragedies spread like wildfire on social media. Why?,Claudia Calleja,29/05/2025,"Photographing and sharing images of tragic accidents on social media is “citizen journalism at its worst” and highlights the urgent need to focus on digital education across the nation, according to experts in communication and human behaviour. The issue came to light once again following a recent fatal traffic accident in which a motorcyclist died on the spot. After the accident, graphic photos were shared extensively via WhatsApp. This had also happened some months ago when footage of another fatal accident, that involved a car losing control, made the rounds on social media. Prof. Anton Grech, clinical chairman of Mental Health Services, explained that while human curiosity in the case of unusual or dramatic situations is normal – a phenomenon known as rubbernecking – social media amplified this. These actions – of taking and sharing images of tragic situations – were a reflection of a larger situation, he said. Before social media existed there were ‘celebrities’ and ‘spectators’. Social media brought with it a shift in which many people wanted to be protagonists. This was happening in a virtual environment that is saturated with content and, in which, in order to be seen and stand out, the content has to be attention-grabbing. “In parallel with this, we are losing respect for the society around us. We saw this in a recent case when a man was threatening to jump off the Valletta bastions,” he said, referring to the 2021 case when onlookers urged a man to jump from the edge of a Valletta bastion, with many filming the ordeal. “Many people seize all opportunities to gain this recognition without respect for others,” he said, adding that there was an urgent need to educate people on this matter. Prof. Brenda Murphy, a media and gender expert and founder of NGO Mediating Women, agreed that there was the urgent need for more media education – in schools and beyond – through curriculum and public campaigns. “This is a public education issue – we need to re-establish digital boundaries. We need to remind people that our duty of care doesn’t disappear when we are online,” she said. Such cases, she said, were “citizen journalism at its worst” as they offered “a great snapshot of the widening gaps in ‘news production’”. “Journalists and editors are trained, educated, bound by professional regulation – citizens operate without any of these guardrails. While citizen journalism was lauded as a great liberator for information – this is an example of a great backfire,” she said. A deeply problematic phenomenon Murphy explained that the sharing of such images was a “deeply problematic phenomenon” that reflects multiple pressures converging at the moment. From a digital culture perspective, she said, we are living in a world where everything is documented, and the boundary between private and public is becoming increasingly eroded. “In the case of tragic moments, there seems to be an underlying belief that if something shocking happens, it should be recorded and shared. The algorithms that drive social media amplify this. They reward visibility, and sadly that includes tragic events,” she said. Then there was the conversation on media ethics.  “We may have the capacity to capture something digitally, but that doesn’t mean we should. Sharing media content has become so normalised it completely breaches the private-public boundary. We need to be mindful that sharing a traumatic event compounds trauma – not just for the family and friends but the wider community is impacted too. We cannot justify this ‘norm drift’ by saying ‘it’s already out there, so it’s ok to repost’,” she said.",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/f302addf97be4fc26709e2b49a5e720146591bf8-1748449827-81b636e5-1920x1280.jpg,Sharing media content has become so normalised it completely breaches the private-public boundary.

New policing unit plans to find out,The unit has dealt with one fatality and 20 accidents involving injuries,Marc Galdes,06/06/2025,"A newly formed Road Policing Unit will be able to determine how and whether the quality of the roads are contributing to traffic accidents.  During a media briefing on Friday, the unit demonstrated how it works. A police car is equipped with a special device linked to a gyroscope on the roof. As the car drives over the road, the device measures the quality of the road surface. During the demonstration, a car sped down the road towards a mock traffic accident and made a sudden stop. The device within the car printed out a piece of paper that included data that helps police understand if poor road conditions may have played a role in a crash. They also need to take other factors into account, such as whether the road is wet or sloped.  They placed numbered yellow cones, which help to identify the evidence as investigations are carried out later on. Depending on the gravity of the situation, the police might even deploy a drone to get a shot of the accident and the surrounding area. The pictures the drone takes can then be used to develop a 3D image of the site, which is then reviewed in their offices. The data collected from this investigation is then passed on to the magistrate who is dealing with the case.

645,https://timesofmalta.com/article/restaurant-canopies-along-the-strand-pose-catastrophic-risk.1111092,Times of Malta,https://timesofmalta.com,Restaurant canopies along The Strand pose ‘catastrophic risk’,"Report commissioned by Sliema resident chronicles series of dangers, illegalities",Marc Galdes,08/06/2025,"The outdoor restaurant structures located all along The Strand pose a “catastrophic risk” to pedestrians and residents, especially if a fire had to break out, a report by a risk management company found. The report highlights a grim reality: fire engines and ambulances have no clear access, and pedestrians are being forced into oncoming traffic. Thousands of people use the stretch of road daily. “The fact that this situation has been allowed to develop into its current state shows a total lack of consideration given to safety of anyone,” a report by Shield Consultants said. Sliema resident Anna Maria Baldacchino, a member of the Sliema Residents Group, lives on The Strand – located on Triq ix-Xatt along Sliema and Gżira – and decided to commission the study herself. The street is lined with restaurants and bars that have built outdoor catering areas protruding into the road, leaving a gap between the building and the outdoor area to allow for a public pavement. Speaking to Times of Malta, Baldacchino said this began last year when an apartment adjacent to hers caught fire, but the fire engines were unable to open their ladders, so the firefighters were forced to gain access through the building. “I was worried because obviously incidents happen and I always thought, if something had to happen what will be the outcome,” Baldacchino said. She resorted to the authorities, however, she never received a straight answer about any form of risk management study. “Nothing happened. At the end of the day, my life and the lives of other residents are at stake here,” she said. ‘High risk of a traffic collision’ The report goes into detail about how the extension of the outdoor areas creates a hazard for cars driving on the inner lane which tend to steer their cars towards the outer lane increasing the “probability of a collision”. The situation also becomes more dangerous if there is a delivery vehicle, which is forced to stop in the middle of the road, as there are no loading bays available. Signed by fire risk management consultant Andre Muscat, the report further noted how the outdoor structures block the view of anyone who wishes to cross at the pedestrian crossing. “Pedestrians need to walk onto the road in order to be seen by approaching vehicles,” the report said.  Given all the obstacles, the report raised serious concerns about the increased risk people face in the event of a fire or other emergency. “There is also the risk of a fire starting in, or spreading to, the outside extension,” the report added. The report noted that these catering establishments are surrounded by residential buildings with only one stairway for access. If residents were forced to evacuate, this would cause “great congestion and confusion”. The report also questioned whether a fire engine would have enough space to utilise hydraulic platforms or turntable ladders, given the protruding canopy. The number of obstructions might also further delay emergency responders from reaching the residents. It added that ambulances might find difficulty parking near the building and further difficulty to get a stretcher through the “crowded and congested environment”. Pavement is hazardous for people with mobility difficulties The obstructed and congested pavement also endangers the elderly and individuals with mobility impairments, the report flagged. It also mentioned the difficulties of walking on the pavement with young children and describing passing through with a pushchair as being “almost impossible”. In the report’s conclusion it said: “The conditions reviewed and reported in the report constitute several instances of a clear and present hazard laden with catastrophic risk potential from the road users to the pedestrians to the residents and even to the customers of the establishments themselves. “Unless brought under control quickly, the situation is only bound to get worse,” the report concluded. This is not the first time Baldacchino has challenged these outdoor structures. In January 2024, she said she applied for permission to take up public land where the restaurant Gourmet Cocktail Bar & Grill had an outdoor seating structure that had been operating illegally for around a decade. Later that month, the Planning Authority approved a permit to sanction the restaurant canopy. Earlier this year, Baldacchino gave a passionate speech in the European Parliament about noise pollution caused by bars and restaurants.",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/83d0a44f271bd268dff6b06b69a1a3872efc4ab1-1749311684-bf24f11a-1920x1280.jpeg,"Fire engines and ambulances have no clear access, and pedestrians are forced into oncoming traffic.",2025-07-03 14:58:49.139238+00,"{Accident,""Food And Drink"",National,Sliema}",{},1,,08/06/2025,08/06/2025 0:00,Low,1,0,Night (00:00-06:00),no,yes,no

The worker suffered severe leg injuries in an accident on August 4 2009 as he worked on the unloading of containers off a ship. He was 52 years old at the time and was wearing safety equipment provided by the Malta Dockers' Union. The man requested payment of damages and eventually sued Malta Freeport Terminals Ltd and shipowners CMA.  He passed away on January 2, 2013. On May 16, 2019, the First Hall of the Civil Court held Malta Freeport Terminals Limited responsible for the injuries and the disability the worker had suffered due to those injuries. It ordered the company to pay the plaintiff €34,648.50 in damages. Back then, his wife, who entered into the suit after he died, appealed the judgment, arguing that the amount was incorrect. She argued that tax and social security contributions should not have been deducted from the damages awarded and questioned whether there was a mistake in the calculation made by the first court. The Court of Appeal held that the court of first instance was wrong when it deducted income tax and the social security contributions from the compensation, as this benefited the respondents and not the plaintiff. As for the calculation of compensation, the Court of Appeal held that it should have been based on the period when Fenech could not work, between August 5, 2009 and April 24, 2011, as well as the period when he returned to work until his death, since Fenech suffered a disability from which he did not recover. The Court of Appeal therefore revoked the €34,648.50 in damages awarded by the first court, and instead awarded the widow €106,816.

On Tuesday, 59-year-old Dione Galdes died after succumbing to injuries he suffered in an accident in Ċirkewwa on Sunday. He was an experienced dive instructor from Iklin who was widely respected in the diving community. Diver David Agius said Galdes was given first-aid attention on the pavement in the sun, in front of other divers. Agius, who runs the diving community website divinginfo.mt, said that it was an unfortunate accident that happened in around two metres of water prior to the actual dive starting. The diving community has repeatedly said that the Ċirkewwa Marine Park does not have a proper first-aid centre, and it has previously appealed for two rooms to be used as a first-aid centre. When news that Galdes suffered serious injuries spread on Sunday, Agius sent an email to the prime minister and the concerned authorities flagging the poor conditions in which Galdes received first-aid care. “All treatment in full view of arriving local divers, diving tourists and passersby for close to 30 minutes, being given CPR in almost 40 degrees of sun until an ambulance from Mater Dei arrived,” the email read. As this happened in public, Agius added that this scene also poorly affected divers mentally. The email reminded the government of the possibility of having two rooms, located next to the divers’ bathrooms at Ċirkewwa Marine Park, serve as a first aid room and a site office for park managers. Currently, these rooms are owned by Transport Malta and leased out to Gozo Channel Operations Ltd.  In April, the website uploaded an article highlighting the shortcomings of first-aid availability on-site. The article explained that first aiders and park managers stay in a rented container in the summer. However, they are unable to rent this in winter due to storms that may hit the area. First aid equipment - AED and spinal board - are located outside the divers' bathrooms, exposed to the sun and rain, it said. Besides this, the park lacks places where proper treatment can be administered, it added. “A better equipped first aid room might provide access to better and more advanced first aid equipment and conditions that may allow better recovery opportunities and/or at least, privacy,” the article wrote. The article referred to a similar incident in October 2024, where a British diver who died after succumbing to injuries was also given CPR for almost 30 minutes outside.

The alleged road rage incident shows the large vehicle driving straight into the car on the road as a man is seen trying to close the back passenger door. Mohamed Hamdan was later identified as the driver of the truck. The incident happened on January 20 on Triq it-Turisti in St Paul’s Bay.

One of the reports states that the car sustained “very extensive damages on the left side panels, rear and right front”. The collision also caused the left side airbags to deploy. The left side panels were pushed onto the passenger’s compartment. The rear extensive damage affected the tailgate, rear panel, tow bar, rear trim and rear right wing.

Giuseppe Di Dio, a 22-year-old Sicilian who works as a DJ and event organiser, was riding his Vespa 300 on July 2 at around 12.30pm when he was hit. As he entered the tunnel heading towards Swieqi, he says a van crossed into his lane, cut him off and crashed into him, knocking him off his Vespa. “I feel super lucky to tell the story. It hurt a lot. When I was on the floor, I could feel my burns,” he told Times of Malta. Shocked by the impact, Di Dio said he could not identify the van but recalled opening his eyes to see the driver standing over him. According to Di Dio, the man looked South Asian and was wearing a blue shirt. He believes he was driving a delivery van but is unsure which company the van belonged to. “He came over, checked I was alive, told me nothing and rushed off,” he said. “I know if I saw him, I would recognise him.” Thankfully, other drivers stopped to help Di Dio. He was taken to Mater Dei Hospital, where he said he had to wait between six to seven hours before being seen. “That was horrible. I couldn’t take it anymore and began to scream out in pain, and only then did they see me,” he said. He was initially told he had minor injuries and was prescribed painkillers. But after several days, his wounds became increasingly painful and doctors at Saint James Hospital later confirmed they were infected. Alongside the physical injuries, Di Dio said his motorbike was damaged and he incurred around €4,000 in expenses for medical treatment, medications, transport and missed work. “I want a refund for the damages but the most important thing is I want to find out who hit me to avoid future accidents,” he said.  After being treated, Di Dio filed a police report. He hoped CCTV footage from the tunnel would help identify the van. But he said police informed him that the security cameras inside the Ta’ Giorni tunnels do not work. “It’s insane. The policeman told me that none of the cameras they have for the tunnels work,” he said. “I told them that it is impossible but they told me again that none of them work.” In 2020, the government launched a €10 million project to upgrade Malta’s major tunnels, including Ta’ Giorni, which included the installation of security cameras. When asked if the cameras were working on the day of the incident, the transport ministry said: “The Traffic Control Centre did not have CCTV coverage in the mentioned area on the 2nd of July 2025.” The ministry did not answer questions about whether the cameras are operational. Police confirmed that a report on the accident had been filed and investigations are ongoing. In 2022, a Transport Malta spokesperson told Times of Malta that tunnel cameras were linked to the authority’s traffic control centre, and used for both congestion monitoring and automatic incident detection.",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/952bfca8822778372482a229951da1ad55938887-1752939698-f9de19d2-1920x1280.jpg,Giovanni Di Dio says he is lucky to have survived the hit-and-run incident earlier this month.

In a statement, the Insurance Association Malta said it “fully supports” Mater Dei emergency department doctor Jonathan Joslin “regarding the urgent need for stronger enforcement and deterrents to address drink and drug driving on our roads.” Joslin called for random testing of motorists in an article published in Monday’s Times of Malta, when he described the lack of legal provisions for such testing as a “critical gap” in enforcement. Referencing data collected by its members in 2022 that found that only around three per cent of serious traffic accidents saw the use of breathalysers, the association said the situation “remains a cause for concern”. It noted it had “long advocated for more robust enforcement in this area”, including participating in the Malta Road Safety Council and proposing legal amendments putting roadside drug testing on the same level of importance as alcohol testing. The association said it “remains committed to supporting road safety measures, as demonstrated in the past with the donation of breathalyser equipment”. “We continue to call on authorities to prioritise investment in the resources and training needed to enable police to carry out consistent, effective roadside testing, particularly in the context of serious traffic accidents.”  It stressed that a “visible and active police presence is not a sign of excessive enforcement but rather a proven deterrent against dangerous driving behaviour”, noting evidence showed that increased monitoring of motorists during the festive season “directly contributes to improved outcomes”. The association urged authorities to “implement both alcohol and drug testing measures more systematically and without delay”. “Road safety is a shared responsibility—and it deserves unwavering commitment.” Joslin said the country should urgently introduce legal provisions allowing police to conduct random breath and saliva testing for alcohol and drugs, with a shift away from the requirement of “reasonable suspicion” essential to deter would-be offenders. The doctor also said the police must have a visible and routine presence on the roads, with random checkpoints, unmarked patrol vehicles, mobile testing units and immediate roadside suspensions of drivers who fail tests.

On Sunday night, mother-of-four Mildred Azzopardi was killed when she was caught between two cars after a car driven by a soldier crashed into a stationary vehicle in Valletta.

Data compiled by transport activist Paolo Cassar Manghi shows that no other seven-day period since at least 2000 has recorded so many road deaths. Cassar Manghi, a transport researcher and road safety advocate, described the spike in fatalities as “tragic but not surprising”, warning that the country’s road infrastructure often encourages speed rather than discouraging risk. Among the six victims were a driving instructor crushed by a runaway bus, a motorcyclist and a pedestrian killed in a crash involving a parked car. On the same week, three others were killed in unrelated violent incidents, in one of the bloodiest weeks in Malta on record. On July 23, a 79-year-old woman from Mosta died after the Renault van she was a passenger in crashed with a Suzuki Swift car in Lija. Three days later, Tenyo Kosev died when his Honda motorcycle was involved in a collision with a BMW 1 Series motorcycle in Pembroke at around 1am. Last Sunday, three people died. Mildred Azzopardi was crushed to death after a vehicle ploughed into a parked car, fatally hitting the 62-year-old. Azzopardi’s husband, Alfred, was critically injured. Benjamin Chetcuti, who was driving the car that hit the Azzopardis, is facing charges of manslaughter and driving under the influence of alcohol. The other two victims were a motorcyclist and a car passenger who was involved in a collision with a car driven by former president George Abela with his wife Margaret in the passenger seat.  Transport Minister Chris Bonett, however, has insisted that the police unit is not a replacement for the bureau and the two bodies will work together. “Two types of investigation are carried out: to establish what led to an accident, and second, to see what happens next... the idea is to work together,” he said in June. Bonett later clarified that the bureau’s main task will be to analyse how to make roads safer and recommend changes.

The test returned a reading of 139.2 μg/100ml (microgrammes of alcohol per 100 ml) of breath or about five times the legal limit, Superintendent Nicholas Vella said at the compilation of evidence against Chetcuti, an AFM soldier arraigned last month. He stands accused of the involuntary homicide of Mildred Azzopardi, driving under the influence and grievously injuring Azzopardi's husband through negligence. He denies the charges. Mildred Azzopardi, 62, from Ħamrun, a mother of four, died at the scene on July 27 when Chetcuti's car ploughed into her car as she put items in the boot. The 23-year-old accused joined the AFM as a recruit in January and on June 10 had his passing out ceremony and was confirmed as a gunner. He was posted to the Maritime Squadron on July 1. Police superintendent Nicholas Vella from the Road Policing Unit testified on how the accident happened at Xatt il-Barrieri, where the Azzopardis had earlier been fishing. Vella played out footage from ten CCTV cameras, explaining that the accused drove around Fort St Elmo initially at 36km/hr. His Subaru Impresa could then be seen at a speed of 246.33/m in nine seconds, meaning an average speed of 98 km/hr. The superintendent said Alfred Azzopardi, the victim's husband, was already in their Ford Fiesta while Mildred was putting some stuff away in the boot when the crash took place. CCTV footage taken from the offices of shipping companies in the area showed the Subaru Impresa arriving at a high speed before the driver lost control and it swerved, hitting Mildred Azzopardi' car first. Azzopardi died on the spot.  Medicolegal expert Mario Scerri testified that Mildred Azzopardi sustained several bone fractures and internal haemorrhage. Her husband suffered  grievous injuries and was in intensive care for a while. He added that Chetcuti tested negative for drugs. His urine sample was sent to another expert for further testing. Medicolegal experts Ali Sarfraz and David Pisani took the witness stand and testified jointly on the findings of the post-mortem examination which showed that Mildred Azzopardi suffered multiple injuries. An eyewitness also took the stand on Tuesday morning. Reeves Cini explained that at the time of the incident he was at the nearby Siege Bell Memorial. “When I arrived on site I found Benjamin,” the witness said, clarifying that he knew the accused from the time the latter worked in Valletta.

Now we are worried how his young family will cope.” Khim Bahadur Pun, 42, from Nepal, was carrying his Wolt delivery bag when his motorcycle was hit by a Maserati car in Birkirkara at 5.25am on Sunday. A 17-year-old driver, who was arrested after fleeing the scene yesterday pleaded not guilty to causing his death and to driving under the influence. Nardevi, 39, who lives in Nepal, said the family are deeply upset and shocked by her brother’s death. Holding back tears, she said the last time she spoke to her older brother was the day before the fatal accident, on Saturday, when the two chatted briefly. “He told me he was coming back to Nepal very soon. He told me that, after three or four months, he would be back,” she said. The middle child of three siblings, Khim moved to Malta over three years ago to work as a courier. His younger sister said their parents are devastated by the news of his death, grieving at the loss of their youngest son. “It was completely unexpected and they are overcome by sadness,” she said. 'Anger and frustration' She described how the family was filled with “anger and frustration” over the loss of Khim, who she described as a “vibrant soul” taken away too soon.  “The circumstances surrounding Khim’s death are unacceptable. This was not an accident; it was a reckless act that resulted in the loss of a precious life. We demand justice for Khim,” she said, highlighting how the driver must be held accountable for their actions. She said Khim’s wife was informed about her husband’s death by his brother’s wife. “She fainted when told and has not stopped crying since,” Nardevi said. She said Khim’s eldest son, who is 14, knows about his father’s death. His younger son, eight, and his six-year-old daughter still do not know. Khim’s sister described him as an honest and hard-working man. “He was a good person and always looked out for others in our community. He was always ready to help someone in need,” she explained. “My family and I are so sad and upset as we lost a huge pillar of our family.” When the family found out the circumstances around Khim’s death, she said the family began to question law and order in Malta. “We want justice for Khim and his family. His family need support and must be kept informed about the case.” €16,000 raised to repatriate the body, help the family Pun’s body will be repatriated on Wednesday a final farewell will be organised by members of the Nepali community outside Mater Dei Hospital at  9am. A vigil for Pun was held by Nepalese nationals near the crash site on Sunday evening, when they lit candles and prayed. A fundraiser organised by the Non-Resident Nepali Association (NRNA) had raised over €16,000 by Monday afternoon to help his family and cover the funeral costs in Nepal. “Seeing this huge support towards the GoFundMe page for Khim shows the kindness and solidarity not only within our own Nepali community but also from the Maltese and other friends around us,” NRNA president, Rems Khanal said.",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/5694a9f980398847c5172f5487105d746a9d3100-1754932713-2ce4bd86-1920x1280.jpg,"Khim, with his younger sister, Nardevi, and their older brother.",2025-08-12 04:43:24.083216+00,"{Accident,Migration,National}",{},1,5.25am,06/08/2025,06/08/2025 5:25,High,0,138.5833333,Night (00:00-06:00),no,yes,yes

The statement comes after Magistrate Joe Mifsud called for random roadside alcohol and drug testing of drivers, after a fatal Senglea motorcycle crash, which took place in June, revealed the rider had cocaine in his system.  The National Alcohol Policy was launched in June to reduce alcohol consumption in the population through ""evidence-based strategies"". The Association said it welcomed the policy's release for public consultation, but raised its concern that the publication, which was delayed by 17 months, is a signal of the authorities' lack of urgency, and how it left out a dedicated section on drink-driving found in the 2018-2023 policy.   The Association pointed to the policy's own data showing that alcohol consumption in Malta rose by 23 per cent between 2010 and 2019, while the European average fell by roughly the same percentage. Almost half of those aged 20 to 49 admit to drinking more than six glasses of alcohol each week.  “The policy acknowledges rising alcohol use across all age groups, yet remains practically silent on the sanctions and enforcement that are crucial to deterring repeat offenders. Education alone is the carrot, but without the stick of enforcement, it will not be enough,” IAM said.  The Association urged the government to follow the lead of other European countries, which were implementing tougher laws to curb drink-driving, including random roadside checks and stricter penalties, such as higher fines and licence suspensions.  It also called for mandatory reporting of driving-under-the-influence cases to insurers. It also called for the introduction of Alcolock devices, a breathalyser installed in a vehicle that would prevent the engine from starting if the driver is over the legal limit. It also suggested introducing subsidised taxi services during large events, coupled with campaigns to promote designated drivers. Finally, it suggested greater use of CCTV footage to identify and deter dangerous behaviour on the roads.  “Educating drivers on the risks is vital, but it must be matched by strong deterrents that make repeat offences far less likely,” IAM said.  The statement comes following a spate of serious road accidents in recent weeks, several linked to drink-driving. The Association also called on the authorities to ensure that the new National Alcohol Policy delivered meaningful change, warning that ""without decisive measures, Malta risks relegating this policy to another missed opportunity, and drink-driving will remain a deadly, preventable threat on our roads” In July, AFM soldier Benjamin Chetcuti was allegedly five times over the alcohol limit when his car hit 62-year-old Mildred Azzopardi in Valletta, killing her and injuring her husband.

Magistrate Joe Mifsud made the recommendation following a magisterial inquiry into the June accident on Triq ix-Xatt Juan B. Azopardo. The 43-year-old motorcyclist lost control, struck a bollard and was killed on the spot. No one else was injured. Toxicology tests conducted during the autopsy found traces of cocaine in his system. In his concluding remarks, Mifsud said that “while it seems that disciplinary measures have started being taken while driving, enforcement needs to increase and officials should be conscious of their role in protecting lives”. He stressed that while discipline has never killed anyone, substance abuse has, with the victims sometimes being innocent, law-abiding citizens who suffer due to the abuse of others. The magistrate urged better coordination between the authorities and constant, rather than sporadic, law enforcement presence on the roads. He referred to a 2023 position paper co-written by NGO Doctors For Road Safety, the Maltese Association of Psychiatry and the Foundation for Welfare Services on drug-driving under the influence of psychoactive drugs.  The paper states that “the use of psychoactive drugs can result in impaired driving skills, leading to an increased risk of road traffic crashes. “It is important to note that the most common psychoactive drugs involved in driving crashes are often taken for recreational purposes, although prescription drugs such as benzodiazepines and opioids can also impair driving skills.” Mifsud endorsed each of the paper’s eight recommendations, including the introduction of a legal framework to enable random drug testing for psychoactive substances, as well as the random screening of professional drivers, such as taxi, school bus, coach and heavy machinery drivers. The paper also called for the establishment of clear guidelines regarding acceptable substance levels in the body while driving, and the review and updating of existing legislation to include penalties for the combined use of drugs and alcohol to reflect the increased risk to road safety. Many European countries allow random or targeted random roadside testing for alcohol or drugs. In the UK, Germany and Malta, the police need “reasonable suspicion” to conduct tests. The Maltese magistrate’s call comes amid a spate of serious road accidents in recent weeks, several linked to drink-driving. In July, AFM soldier Benjamin Chetcuti was allegedly five times over the alcohol limit when his car hit 62-year-old Mildred Azzopardi in Valletta, killing her and injuring her husband.

Abdi Salaan Mahamad Abditon Ali had a reading of 107.3 micrograms of alcohol per 100 ml breath, when the legal limit for cab drivers is zero, after the crash into Marica’s Salon, on Cannon Road, on August 7. A court on Monday heard that he gave a statement to police, in which he said he was waiting for passengers just before the collision. ""Thank God no one requested a cab… It could have resulted in fatalities,” police inspector Nathan Bugeja told the court.   The 42-year-old Somali national stands accused of driving in a negligent, dangerous and reckless manner, causing damage to third property, and driving under influence. He denies the charges. The salon was still closed at the time of the incident and there were no injuries. A police constable testified about receiving a call regarding the collision, with the initial information stating that the vehicle had crashed into a “house”. When the witness got onsite, he found the owner, Marica Baldacchino, who had not seen the incident. The witness went to Mater Dei Hospital where he spoke to the driver. He returned back when another constable was subjecting the driver to the a breathalyzer test. The constable underlined that a cab driver’s limit is 0 μg/100ml. During Monday’s sitting, the prosecution and defence made submissions on bail. Police inspector Bugeja objected due to the seriousness of the crime.  Bugeja also highlighted that although the man’s address on his official documents and the charge sheet state that he lives in St Paul’s Bay, the police accompanied him to a Ħamrun address to collect his passport. Defence lawyer Francesca Zarb counter-argued that the defendant has been in Malta since 2008 and this was his first brush with the law. He was granted subsidiary protection and has a residence permit. The lawyer observed that the court as presided hears cases on traffic collisions and argued that individuals with the same charges are brought before it under summons not under arrest. Zarb also argued that whether the man is granted bail or otherwise, the amount of damages would not be affected. Bugeja rebutted the argument stating that usually collisions do not involve third parties, nor do they involve damages running into thousands of euros. While an exact figure was not given during Monday’s sitting, the damages sustained are between €10,000 to €15,000. These will be confirmed once the salon owner takes the stand. The police inspector also added that the man poses a risk to the public. Zarb observed that two of Ali’s friends were present in the courtroom, with one of them willing to host him. The friend told the court that he came to Malta in 2006 and has known the accused for the past eight years. The court then asked the accused whether he held a bank account, signalling it was willing to grant bail, only if a bank guarantee could be made. After establishing that Ali lacked a bank account with a local bank through which he could guarantee at least €10,000 in favour of the victim, the court denied the man bail. In its decision, the court held that it does not have the peace of mind he would be able to satisfy all conditions otherwise imposed by the court in a bail decree, even though at this stage, the man is presumed innocent until proven guilty.

Police are only equipped with alcohol breathalysers.  In a statement published on Tuesday, MHRA said it backed a call by emergency doctor Jonathan Joslin, who called for random testing of motorists in a Times of Malta opinion piece published on Monday.  Joslin warned MPs that if they did not revise the law, they would have to bear moral responsibility for any ensuing road deaths in which drugs or alcohol are involved.  The MHRA called for the government and MPs to heed Joslin's call, highlighting how the ""time for action is now"". ""MHRA stresses that for a country like Malta, where tourism is a cornerstone of the economy, safety is not opitional, it is essential,"" the statement read. The Insurance Association Malta has also backed the doctor's call for random drug and alcohol testing of motorists.  ""A safe environment on our roads is just as important as the quality of our hotels, restaurants, and attractions. Tourists choose destinations where they can enjoy themselves with peace of mind, and residents deserve the same assurance every day."" MHRA said that random roadside testing would send a clear message that the country people can visit confidently and enjoy responsibly.  ""Such measures do not restrict enjoyment, they raise the standard of living and hospitality for everyone.""  The past few weeks have seen a string of road accidents and deaths linked to drink-driving.  On Monday, a woman involved in a collision that left a motorcyclist critically injured on Sunday was six times over the legal alcohol limit at the time.  In another recent case, a 42-year-old food courier from Nepal was killed when his motorcycle was hit by a Maserati car in Santa Venera. A 17-year-old driver was later charged after fleeing the scene, and pleaded not guilty to driving under the influence.  Mother-of-four Mildred Azzopardi was killed when she was caught between two cars after a car driven by a soldier crashed into a stationary vehicle in Valletta.

The statements came in the wake of another accident caused by drink-driving when a car, driven by a Brazilian man, crashed head on into an oncoming bus in the opposite lane on Tower Road in Sliema. The car driver was four times over the alcohol limit.  Michael Spiteri, who was attending to the first call out of the day at just before 6am on Thursday in the wake of the Sliema accident, warned this could ""have ended in tragedy"". “Irresponsible drivers are putting innocent lives at risk. It is obvious that some are refusing to learn, so the only way forward is random and frequent checks, harsh penalties, and highly visible enforcement to deter this reckless behaviour. This country should act to reduce preventable injuries and deaths,” Spiteri said. In a number of proposals to address the issue, the Opposition insisted on “zero tolerance” for accidents caused by drivers who are found to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, stronger law enforcement, harsher penalties and the introduction of a “new specific criminal offence” for causing death or grievous bodily harm due to gross negligence, recklessness and/or dangerous driving. This offence would carry a minimum penalty of five years’ effective imprisonment, rising up to life imprisonment in cases with aggravating factors, the PN said. Currently, the Police Force has 18 breathalysers, while LESA has five breathalyser kits, all of which only detect alcohol. The PN said the number of road-testing devices “must be increased” and kits that detect drugs should be added. “This is a real and serious problem on our roads,” the PN said. They also highlighted the shortage of staff allocated in the police traffic section and urged for greater investment in the police force, the traffic section and the authorities responsible for road enforcement.

The accident happened on July 19, 2024, when Falzon and her friends were sunbathing in the area of Munxar, beneath the ruins of an 18th-century military battery known as Riħama. Speaking to Times of Malta, Falzon’s parents, Michael and Charmaine, said that while they have heard from government sources that the magisterial inquiry into their daughter’s death has likely been concluded, they are none the wiser as to whether this is true.   Mirabelle’s noisiness was a core part of her character. “She would be in the yard with her boyfriend, and I’d tell her, ‘Does everyone need to know what you’re saying?’ She was always laughing, bringing joy wherever she went. Now the house is silent without her,” Charmaine said. On the one-year anniversary of Mirabelle’s death, her parents organised a mass in her honour. “I can’t thank people enough for coming. The place was packed – everyone still loves her.” Finally, Mirabelle’s father said he had just one request to the authorities. “When someone brings something to your attention, don’t let months and years go by before action is taken. If you save just one life, it’s enough. This is a small country – things shouldn’t fall on deaf ears.

The association said the introduction of random roadside testing is a “significant step forward” in addressing reckless behaviour on the roads and protecting lives. “These measures are not only essential for upholding the rule of law but also for reinforcing Malta’s international reputation as a safe and welcoming destination,” the MHRA said. Prime Minister Robert Abela and Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri announced on Tuesday announced that police will be given the power to randomly test drivers for alcohol or drugs while laws will be revised to ensure anyone involved in fatal crashes while driving under the influence is sent to prison.   Recognising that safety and security are “decisive success factors” for Malta as a “quality tourism destination”, the MHRA said tourists and residents must feel assured that Malta provides a safe and orderly environment, free from risks that undermine wellbeing and public trust. The association stressed that better sustainable tourism management is “inseparable” from responsible enforcement and strong deterrents against behaviour that endanger society. “These reforms will help ensure a higher standard of living for residents and the local community, while delivering outstanding, safe experiences for even the most discerning tourists,” the MHRA added.",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/b1dabb52f5852bb21fbd5a029c809ef9f2585efc-1756284281-866547c6-1920x1280.jpg,"The MHRA says it ""strongly supports"" the introduction of random roadside testing for drugs and alcohol as it will make Malta safer not just for residents for also for tourists.

Yoana Valentinova Gatt, a 44-year-old Bulgarian national living in St Paul’s Bay, admitted earlier this week to causing grievous bodily harm through negligence to the motorcyclist, damaging the victim’s motorcycle, driving under the influence and drink driving. She denies the reckless driving charge, and the case continues with respect to that charge. The incident took place on August 17 when Valentinova Gatt hit the motorcycle from the rear, injuring its driver, a 53-year-old Belgian national living in Gżira.

The motorcyclist was placed in the recovery position until the emergency services arrived at the scene.

The balcony subsequently had to be dismantled as it was deemed unsafe following the impact.  Cyril Spiteri Staines and his wife received a call from ""shocked"" neighbours just after 9pm on Wednesday, who told them a truck had hit their Rabat property and kept going.  Neighbours told them they saw the vehicle responsible but did not note its number plate as it was too dark to see.  “I am more angry than shocked. This savage just breaks our property and drives off like nothing happened,” said Spiteri Staines, 53. Neighbours described the truck as a skiploader without a skip on the back.  The couple live in St Julian's and the Rabat property is currently unoccupied.   Police and Civil Protection Department officials arrived on site shortly after being informed. A report was filed and, after assessing the damage, authorities decided the balcony was too dangerous to leave standing. It was pulled down shortly afterwards. “I tip my hat to the authorities; they did an outstanding job on our end,” said Spiteri Staines.    “Unbelievably, this isn’t even the first time that our house was hit by a truck,” he added. Spiteri Staines explained that around a decade ago, the same house, but on the side facing Triq Tal-Virtù, was damaged when a truck carrying animal feed crashed into it. That time, the driver took responsibility. He said he hoped the outcome this time would be the same. “If the person who crashed into our place was in any way a responsible person, they would have stopped to assess the damage and take accountability, but they didn’t.

Mġiebaħ Bay, in Mellieħa’s Selmun area, is a swimming spot favoured by those wanting to avoid crowds. Pictures posted on social media and others taken by Times of Malta show deep cracks in rock formations just above a flat, clay part of Mġiebaħ that is popular with bathers.  Frenki Dragan Crnjakovic, who flagged the issue on the Facebook group ‘The BEST of Malta’, said he highlighted the issue last year. “A huge chunk of rock is waiting for its moment to crash into the sea. I wrote about this last year but it seems my post didn’t reach many people. Be kind – share with your friends. I believe that it will also reach the official services that will mark or fence off these dangerous areas,” he said.  Mellieħa mayor Gabriel Micallef said he first reported the issue to the police and several government entities last April. He pointed to a particular rock formation that seemed close to dislodging onto the crowd. By May, a report commissioned by the police and drawn up by the Public Works Department’s Project Design and Engineering Directorate confirmed the danger. “It has been observed that large boulders are gradually becoming dislodged due to ongoing coastal erosion,” the report, dated May 9, says. “This natural process is giving rise to areas that pose a significant risk to public safety, especially as the summer season approaches and the bay is expected to attract a high number of visitors for sunbathing and swimming,” it says. The report said that, besides the cracks in the rock formation highlighted by Micallef, other rock formations in other parts of the bay were dangerous. “In view of the above, I strongly recommend that a qualified geotechnical engineer be urgently commissioned to carry out a comprehensive assessment of the site. The objective of this evaluation should be to identify zones of potential danger and advise on any necessary mitigation measures,” the report says. “Given the imminent increase in public use of this location, this assessment should be undertaken as soon as possible to prevent any avoidable incidents.” Correspondence provided to Times of Malta by the Mellieħa mayor shows that the Lands Authority was alerted to the problem. Micallef said that the last communication he had from the authority was in June, when the Lands Authority and the council agreed to install danger signs. “Kindly note that danger signs have been ordered and I will update you with the date of installation,” the e-mail, dated June 24, said. Questions have been sent to the lands ministry. Last year, 22-year-old Mirabelle Falzon died when she was hit by falling rocks at a popular spot in an area known as Munxar, in the limits of St Thomas Bay. The ruins of an 18th-century military battery, known as Riħama, are perched on the cliff overlooking the site. After the incident, several signs were put up, warning that swimming in the area is prohibited, and a fence was erected around the battery itself.  A magisterial inquiry into the tragedy said reports about the dangerous state of the coastal battery in Marsascala, made in the months and years before the collapse killed Falzon, were lost in the bureaucracy of government entities.  The magistrate recommended that a single entity should be responsible for receiving reports about state-owned and private buildings, as well as abandoned buildings and structures like bastions and cliffs that presented a danger to the public. In a statement reacting to the conclusions, the government said it will be implementing the court’s recommendation for there to be one entity “that will receive reports about government buildings or private buildings, as well as about walls, cliffs, or abandoned buildings that pose a danger to the public”.",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/0191d72a735c9d4c5aab804d2c674bdd585860ae-1757481590-792c9e79-1920x1280.jpg,The site at risk of a potentially deadly rockfall.

Mohamed Hamdan, 46, appeared in court yesterday to face a string of driving offences  over a January incident in St Paul’s Bay, in which he allegedly rammed his truck into a car following a traffic dispute. The incident, caught on camera and exclusively revealed by Times of Malta, involved Hamdan allegedly attempting to park his truck to make a water delivery to a hotel. Police inspector Warren Galea told the court that the alleged victim, driving a red Mazda, had overtaken Hamdan and blocked his access to the designated delivery spot on Triq it-Turisti.   The two men exited their vehicles and initially exchanged words. The situation quickly escalated, and a passenger had to intervene to separate them. Hamdan then returned to his truck and drove into the Mazda, which was later declared a total loss. Three other parked vehicles were also extensively damaged. The court heard that the accused was arrested at the time but released on police bail until February 26, pending the submission of medical documentation by the alleged victim. Despite repeated visits by Hamdan to the Qawra police station to seek updates, the requested documents were not submitted until March. The alleged victim presented a medical certificate and vehicle damage valuation report, both dated January. Hamdan also sustained a scratch, which was certified as slight injuries. Hamdan was called back to the police station on April 15. He requested to have his lawyer, Nicholas Mifsud, present before any interrogation. However, inspector Galea explained that due to Mifsud’s involvement in a high-profile jury case, the interview was postponed. Before a new date could be set, the fatal Bidnija shooting occurred. Hamdan was arrested and charged with murdering Jean Paul Busuttil in yet another traffic dispute. Given the circumstances, police decided to file the earlier road rage charges on July 4 without conducting a formal interrogation. Hamdan pleaded not guilty to wilful damage to a car, slightly injuring the driver, damaging three parked cars through negligent and reckless driving, dangerous driving and recidivism. The alleged victim took the stand yesterday. Cautioned that he could face charges himself, the man chose to testify. He said he had been collecting employees from the Buġibba Hotel at around 6.30am when Hamdan’s truck reversed towards him. He claimed he tried to manoeuvre around the truck, asking Hamdan to let him pass so the latter could park. The witness described Hamdan exiting the truck and allegedly swearing and trying to punch him. He said his employees stepped in to defuse the situation, and as he returned to close the back passenger door, Hamdan drove his truck into his car and then several others. Under cross-examination, the alleged victim admitted that his car was in the middle of the road but insisted he had no alternative route to where he was going. He denied pushing Hamdan but admitted to “blocking” him when the accused attempted to strike him. Lawyer Jacob Magri, representing the alleged victim as parte civile, requested a protection order following the testimony. The court, presided over by Magistrate Leonard Caruana, is expected to rule on the matter from chambers. The case continues in October. Police inspector Warren Galea prosecuted. Lawyer Nicholas Mifsud assisted Hamdan. Lawyers Arthur Azzopardi and Jacob Magri are assisting alleged victim.",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/28c38f8aad950cf5cc684df6e752f437bdbf4895-1758130017-f59d90a2-1920x1280.jpg,The truck allegedly driven by Mohammed Hamdan and caught on CCTV.,2025-09-18 04:42:25.001564+00,"{Accident,Court,National}",{},1,6.30am,17/09/2025,17/09/2025 6:30,High,0,17.5,Morning (06:00-12:00),no,yes,no

It was also noted that while the police had alleged that bodycam used by officers on the scene was switched on at the time of the incident, footage was never presented in court. “Had this evidence been presented, it would clearly have helped the court to identify the person behind the wheel,” Magistrate Yana Micallef Stafrace said.

The four were good friends and all lived in Swieqi.  Autopsy results could help shed light on the dynamics of the crash, with Croatian media having reported that the initial suspicion is that the person driving the vehicle may have become ill while driving, leading to the crash.   Jeremy Gambin was a basketball coach at Luxol and a former player who represented Malta at the 1987 Games of Small States of Europe in Monaco. He was also a PE Teacher at St Michael’s Foundation. He and his wife Lorraine, whose official name is Cynthia, had three children and several grandchildren.   Kevin Bonnici worked in the cab business and served as a company director of two separate Y-Plate fleet firms. He previously worked for Air Malta in the airline's finance, flight ops and engineering departments. He and his wife Alexandra had two children and various grandchildren.   Sources told Times of Malta that family members were travelling to Croatia on Saturday, and forensics will continue with the autopsy.  The accident happened at 4.20pm on Thursday, on the D8 state road near Bunica, just south of Senj. Police said the vehicle, travelling from Rijeka towards Senj, is believed to have lost control on a left-hand bend, veered right, struck two stone barriers and fell around 70 metres down a ravine before ending up in the water. Police officer Jasmin Mujaković from the Senj Police Station was among the first to arrive at the scene of the horrific accident, 24sata reported. He surfaced several times for air and then went down under the surface again, trying to find a way to reach the victims. A Croatian diver with over 30 years of experience has described Thursday’s fatal car accident that killed four Maltese tourists as the most difficult intervention of his career. Renato Huba said that while he had similar interventions before, he described the accident as “one of the most difficult”, he told Croatian newsroom. “I prepared myself for the worst situation, but that was not enough; this was much worse,” Huba said.",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/2ae2b04ca16284d15fd8afb8f5b7ce445de8d10c-1759572222-06d02fe7-1920x1280.png,Autopsy results on the two couples who died in the tragic accident in Croatia earlier this week will be known on Monday.

Tonamol Baby, an Indian national, was struck on July 16 and has remained in Mater Dei Hospital’s neurosurgical ward since. Her husband, Jacob Tom, visits her daily, gently speaking to her and holding her hand – a quiet routine that began after the crash that changed everything for the couple. “It’s our first baby. A boy,” says Tom, 34. “Unfortunately, July 20 was my birthday, and my boy passed on July 19.” He paused before adding, “I don’t feel angry. I feel sad.” Tom, a man of small build, smiles as he steps away from his wife for a few minutes to walk out of the ward for the interview. He sits on a blue chair in the waiting room and places two mobile phones on the chair beside him: he carries her mobile around with him. He has been there since 8am. This is where he spends his days – up until it’s time for him to go to work at 6pm. “I am near her every day. In Malta, I am alone. I want to take her home to India. I think having family will help her get better faster,” he says. This is why he has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise the money he needs to take his wife back home, where she can be surrounded by family and continue her care. But this will cost about €50,000, which he cannot afford. An accident that changed everything  Tom came to Malta four years ago and initially worked as a bartender. After completing several courses, he became a sommelier and now works with the db Group. He got married to Tonamol, who he met in the area they are from, Kerala in the South of India. They married three years ago, and she moved to Malta a year later, initially working as a carer at Mater Dei Hospital. After she obtained her bridge course, she became a nurse and was based at St Vincent de Paul Residence. Tom usually joined her on her commute to work every day. “I will wake up when she gets ready for the duty and we take the bus from Buġibba where we live. After I drop her off, I will come to sleep,” he says.  Holding on to hope Doctors told him there was no hope. They did not expect her to make it beyond 48 hours. But she did. And now days became weeks and months. “She is still in a coma state, but she is totally different now. I can see almost the same face. She started to open her eyes. There is eye contact, but she is still not responding. There has been miniature progress from the first day but, for me, there were big changes,” he says, insisting that he is hopeful. He spends his day near her. For over a month, he did not report to work. But he has now decided to return – for his mental health and to earn the money he needs. “Recently I started working – my company, which I belong to, are very supportive. Every day I'm here… I’m away from here just for work. I work from 6pm to 1am. I get home at 3am. By 8am I am near her until it's time to go to work,” he says. But here in Malta he has no family support. This is why he would like to take his wife back to India where she will be provided with care for her condition and surrounded by family. But getting her home is too expensive. She would have to be transported in a medical ambulance for the cost of €20,000 and the hospital care is estimated to cost another €30,000. “I will be with her for a couple of months. Then, I hope, she will be okay, and I will bring her back with me.” Anyone who would like to help Tom take his wife home to India can access the crowdfunding page https://gogetfunding.com/prayers-and-support-needed-for-tonamol-babys-recovery/",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/40ba78aa3cfb4d0eb3df432392883c190cf5e2f5-1759651269-07b1542d-1920x1280.jpeg,The couple,2025-10-05 08:42:00.989689+00,"{Accident,National}",{},1,6pm,05/10/2025,05/10/2025 18:00,High,1,0,Evening (18:00-00:00),no,no,no

The victims – Jeremy and Lorraine Gambin and Kevin and Sandra Bonnici – were lifelong friends and cousins who regularly holidayed together across Europe and beyond. “They were not only cousins but best friends who travelled all over the world together. They’ve driven around together for tens of thousands of kilometres,” Justin Gambin, one of the victims’ sons told Times of Malta. The fatal crash occurred on the D8 state road near Bunica, close to the coastal town of Senj, when their rented car struck two stone barriers and fell some 70 metres into the sea below. Croatian emergency divers described the recovery operation as one of the most difficult they had ever carried out.  Relatives of the victims, including their children, are currently in Senj, where on Monday they laid flowers near the crash site in memory of their loved ones. In their first comments to the media since the tragedy, the Gambin and Bonnici families expressed deep gratitude to the Croatian authorities and local community for the “incredible support” shown in the aftermath of the tragedy.  All the victims’ personal belongings have since been returned to the families who are now waiting for the autopsy results.  Meanwhile, questions have been raised about the safety of the D8 road, where certain stretches lack adequate barriers to prevent cars from plunging into the sea below. ""While the stone bollards along the road may appear protective, they were likely insufficient to prevent a vehicle from veering off the road,” said Jonathan Gambin, whose 68-year-old brother was among the victims. Gambin said the family hopes that further investigations into the accident will bring some kind of closure.  The tragedy shocked Malta and is believed to be the highest death toll of a crash involving Maltese nationals abroad.  It came almost exactly a month after another Maltese couple, Doris and Manuel Buhagiar, were killed in a car crash in Sicily.",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/5428d984755d8caafafef065f77a5537d1b7d238-1759754172-4876b6cc-1920x1280.jpeg,Family members paid their tributes on the site of the tragedy on Monday.,2025-10-06 13:11:20.300815+00,"{Accident,Croatia,National}",{},1,,06/10/2025,06/10/2025 0:00,Medium,0,0,Night (00:00-06:00),no,no,no

Dennis Attard, 49, of Triq l-Imsida, Santa Venera, faced five charges stemming from a collision on 23 September 2024 in Triq Censu Tabone, St Paul’s Bay, including reckless driving, causing involuntary damage, driving without a licence, driving an unlicensed vehicle, and driving without insurance.
The case centred on a collision between Attard’s vehicle and a motorcycle ridden by Marland Herman Jones.
Jones told the court he was riding down a narrow street when a car “just kind of jumped in” and pulled out in front of him. “I braked as hard as I could but I hit the I believe his door or the front right quarter panel,” he testified, adding that he “just kind of fell over and jumped up cursing.”
Jones explained that the driver claimed he had to leave urgently because “his daughter was giving birth.” They exchanged phone numbers via WhatsApp, but when Jones attempted to contact him, he received no response despite seeing the messages had been viewed. “I tried to contact him again, no answer. He viewed the I saw it through the messaging app. I could tell that he watched it,” Jones testified.
However, when asked to identify the accused in court, Jones admitted: “Actually at at this date I can’t recognize him in court, if this is the gentleman, I don’t quite recognize him, I have to be honest.” He explained he had identified someone at the police station “over 8 months ago” but “couldn’t tell you now.”
The defence suggested Jones had hit the car from behind, but Jones firmly rejected this, stating repeatedly: “That’d be completely incorrect” and “That’d be incredibly incorrect.”
Magistrate Yana Micallef Stafrace dismissed all charges on Monday, ruling that Jones “did not recognise the accused in Court” and noting his claimed identification at the police station “does not result from the police affidavit.”
Moreover, the court found that “on the day of the collision the right to silence was not administered to the accused as required by law.”
Court therefore concluded that “the evidence does not provide beyond reasonable doubt all the elements of the crime, and therefore the imputations have not been proven to the degree required in the criminal field.”
Attard chose not to testify and was acquitted of all charges.",https://cdn.newsbook.com.mt/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/14173250/WhatsApp-Image-2023-05-14-at-17.26.56.jpeg,,2025-10-06 20:22:06.418272+00,"{Accident,Police,Traffic}",{},1,,06/10/2025,06/10/2025 0:00,Medium,0,0,Night (00:00-06:00),no,no,no

The incident occurred at a renovation site near Plaza Mayor, a busy area in the heart of the Spanish capital.
Search underway for missing workers
Firefighters and rescue teams were deployed immediately after several floors of the building gave way, causing a cascade collapse that reached the basement level.
According to Francisco Martín Aguirre, the central government’s representative in the Madrid region, the damage was “very severe”, and assessments were underway to determine whether neighbouring buildings had been compromised.
Deputy Mayor Inmaculada Sanz said that search efforts were ongoing for four missing individuals, three men and one woman. Emergency responders were using drones to scan the wreckage while nearby properties were being evacuated as a precaution.
Initial reports from Madrid’s emergency services indicated that three workers had sustained injuries, none of which were serious. Mayor José Luis Martínez-Almeida later confirmed that one of the injured had been taken to hospital.
Earlier estimates from Martín Aguirre suggested that up to 10 people might have been hurt, but municipal authorities later revised the figure down to three. Emergency officials maintained that all injuries were minor.
Witness accounts
The collapse sent shockwaves through the surrounding streets. Witnesses described hearing a powerful explosion before a massive cloud of dust engulfed the area.
“There was an enormous blast that shattered all the glass,” said Milagros García Benito, who works at a nearby hair salon. “You couldn’t see a thing, everything was white. Then the firefighters and police arrived almost immediately.”
Police cordoned off the site, which was soon filled with ambulances, fire engines, and emergency personnel as crowds of onlookers gathered.
Sanz warned that the rescue and stabilisation work would be extensive, stating that “the amount of rubble is very significant” and that operations “will last quite some time, possibly several days”.
The building, originally an office block, was being converted into a hotel after receiving planning approval from Madrid City Hall in February. Land registry data lists the structure as a six-storey property covering roughly 6,745 square metres (about 73,000 square feet).
Investigation underway
Authorities have not yet determined the cause of the collapse. Engineers and safety inspectors were expected to begin a detailed assessment once rescue operations concluded.
The Madrid municipal police said surrounding buildings would remain evacuated until stability could be guaranteed.
Emergency services continue to work at the site, prioritising the search for the missing workers amid concerns about further structural instability.

Motiraj Paudel suffered head injuries in what witnesses described as an unprovoked attack in the early hours of Sunday, at the corner of Triq San Ġorġ and Triq L. Apap. The 43-year-old from Nepal said he was driving along the road when he found it blocked by a badly parked white Mercedes “half on the pavement and half in the road”. “When I told the driver he was parked illegally, he and another man got out of the car and one of them punched me three or four times in the head,” Paudel told Times of Malta. He was knocked out and, after coming to his senses a minute later, a group of women who had witnessed the assault called an ambulance, which took him to Mater Dei Hospital for treatment. “The [taxi] driver was completely peaceful and did nothing to provoke the attack,” a shocked witness said. “We went to the police station immediately to report what we saw but they did not ask for any ID or contact details,” she added. A police spokesperson said a report had not been filed at the time of writing but the victim said he thought his medical report would be sent to the police. Paudel, who was forced to take time off work due to his injuries, said he had been living in Malta for the past six years. 'Racist insults but never a physical assault' He said that, in his four years working as a bus driver and two years as a taxi driver, he had experienced occasional racist insults but never a physical assault. “I just asked him politely to move. This isn’t how you should resolve problems in a civilised country,” he said. The incident follows another reported case of road rage that occurred two days prior, in which three people were involved in a brawl in the middle of Triq Manwel Dimech, in Sliema. Those involved ultimately chose not to pursue the matter with a police report, opting instead to apologise. In May, dashcam footage captured a driver assaulting a tourist attempting to cross a zebra crossing, also in Sliema.

Jeremy and Lorraine Gambin and their best friends Kevin and Sandra Bonnici were killed last Thursday when their Land Rover Discovery plunged off a cliff and veered into the sea on the D8 state road near Bunica, just south of Senj. The funeral of the Gambin couple will be held on Saturday at Balluta church at 9.30am, the victims' son Justin Gambin told Times of Malta. The date of the funeral of the other couple is not yet known.  The four - aged between 66 and 68 - were lifelong friends who regularly holidayed abroad together. In a statement to Times of Malta, the Gambin family said: ""Jeremy and Lorraine, humble and loved by all, lived life to the fullest. They left us doing what they loved most with their best friends."" Drowning most likely cause of death Meanwhile, autopsy results reported by Croatian media say drowning was the most likely cause of death of the two couples, as only slight injuries were found on the bodies. All four are believed to have been wearing seatbelts. Forensic investigations are ongoing with experts unable to determine what caused the car to veer off the road. Initial reports in the Croatian media that the driver of the vehicle may have become ill while driving, thus leading to the crash, were not verified by the autopsy. The vehicle fell around 70 metres after veering off the road, before crashing into the sea to a depth of at least 11 metres. The investigation was conducted by forensic medicine specialists from the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Rijeka. Relatives of the four victims, including their children, laid flowers near the crash site in memory of their loved ones.  Justin Gambin said his father and Kevin Bonnici were “not only cousins but best friends who travelled all over the world together. They’ve driven around together for tens of thousands of kilometres”. Speaking to Times of Malta on Wednesday, he thanked the Croatian police in Senj for their assistance.  Questions on safety of road Meanwhile, questions have been raised about the safety of the D8 road, where certain stretches lack adequate barriers to prevent cars from plunging into the sea below. Jonathan Gambin, whose brother was among the victims, said that while stone bollards along the road “may appear protective, they were likely insufficient to prevent a vehicle from veering off the road”. He had expressed hope that further investigations into the accident would bring the victims’ relatives a measure of closure. It is not known whether the Senj Bora, the notorious strong northeasterly wind that blows along the Adriatic coast of Croatia, could have potentially contributed to the accident. There has also been some speculation in the Croatian media that an oncoming car could also have distracted the Maltese driver.  Croatian emergency divers described the operation to recover the car involved in the crash as one of the most difficult they had ever carried out, with experienced diver Renato Huba telling local media that while he had prepared for the worst, “this was much worse”. A member of the towing service praised a policeman who was among the first to arrive on the scene and who dived into the water in an attempt to open the door of the car damaged by the force of impact. ""He tried everything he could. He jumped, dived, tried to open the door, but due to the extensive damage and the strong water pressure, it was simply not possible.

The footage shows a silver vehicle crashing into the back of a red car in front as the latter stops at a Paola roundabout, as Transport Malta’s (TM) deputy head of enforcement Jean Claude Attard is interviewed in the foreground live on TVM. Attard appears startled at the sound of the accident before looking around to the scene of the bumper-to-bumper in the background, while the presenter continues speaking. The accident occurred just moments after the presenter said the pair were “here in the early hours of the morning, when traffic seems to be at its peak – which is normal for the country”.  Reacting to the incident, Attard tells the presenter: “As you can see, these things happen on the go, as behind us, we have a bumper-to-bumper which can take a while to clear the vehicles from the street”. He added that TM officials would “place markers on the ground of where the crash happened to move the cars as fast as possible” in addition to their duties directing traffic at what he described as “one of the busiest junctions in the south”. TM officials can be seen attending the scene shortly after the incident occurs. Thursday’s on-air accident comes as Malta continues to battle perennial congestion and frustration on the roads. On Tuesday, gridlock was particularly bad across the country as Malta registered 23 collisions, 10 vehicle breakdowns and two separate spillages across the island during morning rush hour. Motorists reported spending more than double the usual time on their commutes, and many took to social media to express frustration, complaining about standstill traffic that stretched even onto non-arterial roads. The issue spilt over into parliamentary proceedings later that day when Opposition Leader Alex Borg quipped to Robert Abela that he was delayed because, due to not being escorted like the prime minister, he was stuck in traffic.",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/53c7a5a23afb1224dd3e6d6b1532dd5f71e33fb0-1760000704-7a6ec822-1920x1280.png,TM official Jean Claude Attard appears uneasy as a car accident takes place metres behind him live on air.

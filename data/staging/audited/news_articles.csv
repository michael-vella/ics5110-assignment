4208,Driver stuck in traffic says speeding LESA car shattered his mirror,"A motorist claims his car mirror was shattered by a speeding LESA vehicle that failed to stop after hitting his car while he was stuck in traffic. Frank Xerri De Caro, 78, was driving his Toyota Yaris home after a meeting on Wednesday around 5pm when the accident occurred on the Regional Road, near the St Julian’s tunnels. Heavy traffic had brought vehicles to a near standstill, leaving little room for manoeuvring. As he approached the tunnels next to St Clare’s Convent, Xerri De Caro said he noticed what he then believed to be a police car with sirens blaring in the distance. Attempting to give way, he moved his car closer to the side of the road. “I could tell the car was coming quite close to me but I couldn’t move anymore as I didn’t have more space to,” he explained. Moments later, he said a speeding LESA vehicle struck his right-hand side mirror, shattering it into pieces on the ground. Xerri De Caro described feeling both shocked and frustrated, notably when the car continued without stopping to assess the situation. “I was shocked at that moment but more so frustrated afterwards,” he said, explaining that he had to spend €300 to repair the damage. Xerri De Caro, who shared his experience on social media, initially said his mirror was destroyed by a police car. After filing a police report and speaking with the police on Thursday morning, he noticed he made a mistake and said that it had been a LESA car that hit his mirror.  He took to social media once again to praise the police for their efficient work and thanked them for their assistance.  LESA responded to the matter in question by saying, ""LESA has received no communication regarding this matter from the injured party prior to this media question."" They continued, "" LESA invites the injured party to provide all relevant information so that the necessary checks can be made, in accordance with the usual procedure.""",07/12/2024,2025-07-03 15:14:21.554132+00,04/12/2024 17:00,TRUE,Regional Road,St Julian's,0,not injured,Car,78,M

4167,PN slams government for diverting EU bus funds to electric private cars,"The PN on Monday slammed the government for diverting EU funds that were meant to be used to electrify Malta’s public transport to fund subsidies for electric private cars. By encouraging the use of private cars, the government would make the traffic situation on the island even worse, three party spokespeople told a press conference at the Marsa park-and-ride on Monday. Last week, the PN revealed that the government had ""secretly"" withdrawn plans to receive over €40 million in EU funding to spend on updating Malta’s bus fleet. As a result, the private company that runs the public transport system said its plans to electrify Malta’s bus fleet “cannot go ahead”. In reply to questions by Times of Malta, Prime Minister Robert Abela confirmed the funds that were going to be used for the project will instead go to people to electrify their private cars. But for the PN, switching diesel-powered buses to electric ones would have been a crucial initiative to reduce emissions and combat climate change. ""Since these buses operate throughout the day on our roads, they should be the first priority in the electrification of Malta's vehicle fleet. ""Instead, Robert Abela made the meaningless decision to withdraw the allocation of these funds, leaving diesel buses on the roads while redirecting funds to more private cars, worsening traffic. This comes after the government reduced the grant for private electric cars in the recent budget from €11,000 to €8,000."" Spokespeople Mark Anthony Sammut, Ryan Callus, and Eve Borg Bonello told the media on Monday that the decision to withdraw from the €34 million agreement with the European Commission would also result in the loss of €7 million in EU funds for charging stations and another €50 million in private investment for cleaner air. ""This reckless decision by Abela confirms his lack of direction and how quality is discarded with every decision he makes. ""If he really needed to cut funds, Abela should have reduced wasteful spending on core government insiders and the corruption that has engulfed his administration,"" they said, adding that quality of life depended on clean air. They added that due to PL's incompetence, people's health will continue to suffer from the exhaust fumes of diesel-powered buses passing past pedestrians. ""The PN is the only solution for the Maltese people. We promise electrified mass transport that will not only reduce emissions on our roads but also provide an efficient and adequate service. ""Above all, we promise accountability and seriousness in public spending and in the use of European funds in the interest of the common good, not just for the privileged few."" PL reacts Reacting to the PN's press conference, the PL said in a statement the Opposition's true colours were revealed on Monday morning. ""Under a Nationalist government, the thousands of grants given for a person to switch from traditional fuel to electrification of a vehicle will no longer be given,"" the PL claimed. The party said that a Labour government will, on the other hand, continue providing incentives to those who opt for an electric vehicle. The incentives will not just apply to the purchase of a car but also when it comes to the registration and circulation tax relief from the road licence. ""Strong initiatives for those who make the choice to go for a private vehicle, with the least possible environmental damage."" That is the difference between austerity measures and incentivising people.",09/12/2024,2025-07-03 15:14:10.643172+00,09/12/2024 0:00,FALSE,,,,,,,
4093,Motorcyclist seriously hurt in St Paul's Bay bypass crash,"A motorcyclist was rushed to hospital in a critical condition after he smashed into a stationary garbage skip on the St Paul's Bay bypass on Wednesday afternoon. The incident was reported to the police at around 5pm.  A police spokesperson said the man - a 54-year-old English man from Mellieħa - suffered serious injuries and was rushed to Mater Dei Hospital. According to the police, the man lost control of his Honda and crashed into a stationary skip on the bypass.",11/12/2024,2025-07-03 15:13:50.605708+00,11/12/2024 17:00,TRUE,St Paul's Bay bypass,St Paul's Bay,1,Serious,Motorbike,54,M
4110,Skip involved in horror St Paul’s Bay bypass crash 'did not have permit',"A private contractor who placed a skip on St Paul's Bay bypass that was involved in a serious road accident on Wednesday did not have a permit, local authorities say.  The mayor of St Paul’s Bay, Infrastructure Malta, and Transport Malta all said they did not grant permission for the unnamed contractor to place a skip on the road on Wednesday.  A 54-year-old motorcyclist was seriously injured when he crashed into the stationary garbage skip left on a blind bend along the bypass.  Transport Malta said it ""was not informed about the works, and the contractor did not hold a valid permit to carry out works at the site where the accident occurred.""  Similarly, Infrastructure Malta said it ""had not been notified about the works, and no permission was requested for them."" However, it acknowledged that the accident occurred near works being carried out by a private contractor under its administration. It did not name the contractor involved. In October, Infrastructure Malta began work to replace a dangerous leaning wall along the same bypass section where the accident happened. St Paul’s Bay Mayor, Censu Galea, also confirmed that the council had not issued any permits. ""No permits were ever issued as far as I am informed,"" he said. He said he was told the skip was placed on the road at around 1pm on Wednesday. The incident was reported to the police at around 5pm.  The mayor noted that the same skip had been in the same location two to three months ago, and people raised safety concerns with the council at the time. He explained that once he was informed, the council alerted Infrastructure Malta, which added cones and bollards at that time. The skip involved in Wednesday’s accident was left at the final curve leading to the Xemxija roundabout. According to the police, the injured motorcyclist, an English man from Mellieħa, lost control of his Honda and collided with the skip. He remains in Mater Dei Hospital with serious injuries. While traffic cones and a bollard were at the site, an eyewitness and social media users described these safety features as insufficient.",12/12/2024,2025-07-03 15:13:54.812813+00,11/12/2024 17:00,TRUE,St Paul’s Bay bypass,St Paul's Bay,1,Serious,Motorbike,54,M
4066,"Two people, including teenage girl, critically hurt in two separate crashes","A 29-year-old man and 17-year-old girl were critically injured in two separate traffic accidents on Friday, the police said in two statements. The first incident occurred in Mellieħa at around 5.30pm, when the 17-year-old was hit by a Jeep Grand Cherokee on Triq il-Marfa.

4067,"Tributes, anger flow for motorcyclist killed after slamming into a skip","Dieter Vink was a true gentleman, said friends of the 54-year-old British motorcyclist, who died on Friday night, two days after crashing into a skip placed on a curve of the bypass leading to Xemxija. Friends and acquaintances have remembered Vink as a warm and principled man who left an indelible mark on their lives but there is palpable anger over whether the tragedy could have been prevented.  Fleur Marie Cilia Buckett, who had been friends with Vink for 17 years, described the victim as ""an amazing man"" who stood by her in her darkest hours. In return, she stayed by his side in the hours following his tragic crash. “He was a man full of morals, good Yorkshire stock, and an animal lover to his core,” she said. Buckett recalled how they met on the social platform Hi5, where Vink adopted his beloved cats, Xemx and Bomba, who are now in need of a new home. Buckett expressed her devastation upon learning of his accident from a Times of Malta online report. “My heart stopped, and I howled in disbelief. He was so careful - that could have easily been any of us.” Determined to honour her friend’s memory, Buckett is organising a bike ride in his name on December 28, starting at Mater Dei Hospital and ending at Xemxija Pitstop, where donations will be collected to help pay for his cremation and lawyers' fees. They will also set up a GoFundMe page for the above.  “I can assure you I will fight tooth and nail till justice is served,” she added.  Dorian Sid Turner, a fellow motorcyclist and a friend of Vink for 10 years, echoed these sentiments. “The world lost a true gentleman,” he said, reminiscing about how Vink, a freelance hairdresser, would cut his and his son’s hair. “He was such a good listener. Even if I was having a bad day, somehow he could make me smile,” Turner added. Speaking on behalf of the biking community, he vowed that Vink’s death would not be in vain. “We will not rest until justice is served,” Turner said. Vink, who lived in Malta since the 1990s, originally hailed from Yorkshire, England. After training as a hairdresser, he later became a customer service specialist. For the past five years, he was a familiar face at the Xemxija Pitstop, where owner Vickie Cutajar described him as “a true gentleman” and “a very good client.” “Dieter was warm and friendly,” Cutajar said, adding that customers recognised him immediately from news reporting the accident because of his motorcycle. She shared how Vink would often stop by on his way to work for his usual Americano and toast, a routine the staff will deeply miss. The police confirmed that Vink was riding his Honda motorcycle on Wednesday evening when he collided with the skip. Although emergency responders took him to Mater Dei Hospital, he succumbed to his injuries on Friday. Transport Malta, Infrastructure Malta, and the St Paul’s Bay local council have denied issuing any permit for the skip to be placed in the busy thoroughfare. The skip is believed to have been placed by a contractor working on a boundary wall. St Paul’s Bay mayor Censu Galea said that residents had previously raised safety concerns about the skip, which had been placed at the same location months earlier.",14/12/2024,2025-07-03 15:13:44.081826+00,11/12/2024 17:00,TRUE,St Paul’s Bay bypass,St Paul's Bay,1,Fatal,Motorbike,54,M

4007,TM suspends permits of contractor responsible for skip involved in fatal crash,"Transport Malta has suspended future permits for the contractor responsible for a skip left on the St Paul’s Bay bypass that was hit by a motorcyclist in a fatal accident last week. In a statement on Monday evening, TM said it had “suspended any future permits for this contractor until all safety standards are assured,” while confirming the contractor had “illegally” resumed works last week without a valid permit or informing the agency. “These works had been stopped for months, and any resumption without proper authorisation is entirely the responsibility of the contractor,” it said. Dieter Vink, 54, was riding a Honda motorcycle on Wednesday evening when he smashed into the stationery garbage skip placed on the bypass' final curve leading to the Xemxija roundabout. The collision left Vink in a critical condition and he was taken to Mater Dei Hospital for treatment, there succumbing to his injuries on Friday night. Footage of the incident generated an outpouring of grief and anger, with many calling for accountability over what they claimed as negligence on the part of the contractor. Times of Malta has been informed by multiple sources that the contractor in question is JV Infrastructure. Repeated attempts to contact the company were unsuccessful. Vink’s family have said they “want justice, and we will not let him pass in vain,” and have demanded accountability for the events that led to the popular hairdresser’s death. Speaking to Times of Malta less than 24 hours after his death, the family said Vink had suffered catastrophic brain trauma in the accident, with other injuries including a broken right arm, several fractured ribs, a punctured liver and spleen, two black eyes and cuts and bruises all over his body. Fleur Marie Cilia Buckett said the crash helmet the motorcyclist was wearing at the time of the crash looked like “corn flakes,” while stressing Vink was a careful rider. “That could have easily been any of us,” she said. The skip left on the road earlier that day is believed to have been placed there while JV Infrastructure was carrying out works on a boundary wall in the area.  St Paul's Bay mayor Censu Galea said the skip had also been placed on the road a few months before the fatal incident and that residents nearby had complained at the time about it being a danger.",16/12/2024,2025-07-03 15:13:29.189831+00,11/12/2024 17:00,TRUE,St Paul’s Bay bypass,St. Paul’s Bay,1,Fatal,Motorbike,54,M
4024,‘I’m tired of going to friends’ funerals’: bikers' anger after skip crash death,"The president of a motorcycle advocacy group has expressed his anger at the perceived negligence of the authorities, which he says led to the death of a biker last week. Dieter Vink, 54, died last Friday, two days after crashing his motorcycle into a skip positioned on the final curve of the St Paul’s Bay bypass before the Xemxija roundabout.  “I’m sick of going to funerals. It feels like our lives are cheap,” Galea said, mentioning the deaths of Johanna Boni, after being hit by a truck in 2015, and Marie Claire Lombardi, who lost control of her bike after it skidded on olives spilled onto the road in 2022. Speaking about the experience of riding a motorcycle more generally, Galea said it had become more dangerous to drive on Malta’s roads over the past four or five years. “I think it’s because drivers are frustrated by the ever-increasing traffic, which in turn leads them to drive in an impatient and careless manner. Right now, the situation feels like it’s beyond repair,” he said. Aldo Overend, a committee member of the NGO, echoed Galea’s sentiments.  “We just hope this accident will lead to action because we can’t go on like this,"" he said. ""While riding, I feel like I constantly have to dodge heavy vehicles, construction materials, fresh concrete and water leaking from bowsers, as well as reckless car drivers not taking us into account.""

3999,Doctors ask: Where is the Transport Safety Investigative Commission?,"A promised Transport Safety Investigative Commission whose setting up was promised in December 2022 has still not materialised, the Doctors for Road Safety said on Tuesday. The NGO noted the recent 'horrific' crashes and expressed condolences to the victims. The promised commission, it said, was essential to investigate such crashes and bring about changes to prevent their reoccurrence. The setting up of the commission, it recalled, was promised following the first National Road Safety Conference it organised in 2022.  ""This lethargy is symptomatic of road safety not being given its urgent due priority by policymakers in this country."" The NGO urged road users to be cautious and attentive on the roads, especially during the festive season. Last September, the Insurance Association of Malta also expressed concern about the delayed Transport Safety Investigation Commission and the Road Safety Bureau that was to be part of it.  Currently, magisterial inquiries and police investigations are the only methods of investigating road accidents in Malta. These inquiries determine civil or criminal liabilities, and their conclusions generally remain confidential. Times of Malta had reported that the bureau was delayed by the judiciary’s hesitancy to share the contents of magisterial inquiries owing to the confidentiality of investigations and the privacy of those involved.  In April, Times of Malta also reported that the existing Road Safety Council, which brings together road safety stakeholders, had not met since appointing a new chairman five months previously.",17/12/2024,2025-07-03 15:13:27.107065+00,17/12/2024 0:00,FALSE,,,,,,,

We had to go through all our belongings, throw out what could not be saved and save what we could. We cleaned, scraped and scrubbed walls, floors and ceilings. We did most of the work ourselves, but help came in from everywhere. People gave us furniture, clothes, food and even new tiles and a kitchen,” says Christine as she stands in front of their donated Christmas tree together with her husband, Patrick, and their two young sons Zaylen, six, and Zyon, three.   Slowly things started taking shape. Her husband's employer provided the replacement tiles and they got help with the plastering. Now they are mostly done, but they still have missing doors and windows which are currently replaced by curtains or plywood planks. They also need to finish their bathroom which is currently make-shift. But Christine is determined to stay positive. Even though, as the anniversary of the fire approached, she started getting anxious.  With the support of a psychologist, she managed to push through her fears and decorated for Christmas this year again.

3861,Mother calls for stricter penalties after son’s road death,"The mother of a 21-year-old man who died in a traffic accident two years ago believes the courts are too lenient in suspending the licences of drivers responsible for serious or fatal collisions. Fiona Laferla’s son, Ben, was a passenger in a rental car driven by his friend, Maxime Asacha Muehlematter, when it crashed into a wall on Triq il-Madliena in Swieqi. Last month, Muehlematter received a suspended jail sentence and a one-year driving ban after admitting to involuntarily causing Ben’s death on September 24, 2022. Maltese traffic regulations stipulate a minimum driving ban of six months to a year, with courts having discretion over the final length based on the specific circumstances.  Lingering questions In court, it emerged that the front seatbelts were elongated but those at the back were stiff, indicating Ben and Flo had not been wearing them. After the crash, first aiders found Ben outside the car. A passer-by pulled him out to try to help. Max’s 17-year-old girlfriend initially claimed she was driving. She later admitted she lied, thinking her age would protect her from charges. She received a conditional discharge. A bottle of rum and another bottle of alcohol was found in the car, leading to public assumptions about the group’s behaviour. Fiona derides the “callous comments” and clarifies that Ben had had the bottle of rum for weeks. Fiona remains unconvinced about the reported speed of 35km/hr, noting that Ben’s injuries seemed too severe. “You know how many times my sister and I tried taking a sudden break at that speed to try to understand? I know that stupid things happen. In this case, there was a wall. But there are still questions.” The mother says the car safety element was never explored during the court case. “There is always a fault – but there are other things to consider that go beyond the driver: is the car properly maintained? Is the road too dark?” Fiona was hoping the court case would give her the answers. It did not, and she found it painful when a defence lawyer attempted to discredit Ben and Flo, even though they were sitting at the back. In the end, following a change of lawyer, Max admitted to causing Ben’s death. The prosecution withdrew charges relating to reckless and negligent driving as well as driving under the influence, because there was no material evidence that could lead to a conviction. “I wasn’t hoping Max goes to prison because I wasn’t out for vengeance.

3834,"Driver paid for damages he was never accused of causing, court hears","A driver who was conditionally discharged over a collision that took place 18 years ago, paid for damages to the other driver’s vehicle when he was never charged with causing such damages but only for injuries suffered by that driver’s passenger. Emanuel Gatt was targeted by criminal charges following the accident which took place in Triq il-Mithna, Qormi on December 17, 2006 when he was involved in a collision which resulted in grievous injuries to a woman in the other car. Gatt was subsequently prosecuted for careless and dangerous driving, driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, having an alcohol level beyond the legal limits as well as causing grievous injuries to the woman. The proceedings dragged on until earlier this year, when the case was assigned to a new magistrate. Eighteen years down the line, Gatt registered an admission to three of the charges, including that related to the injuries involuntarily caused to the victim. When examining the evidence to determine whether Gatt was guilty of the other charges the court, presided over by Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech, observed that the only witness who testified in the proceedings was a medical doctor who confirmed that the victim fractured a left-hand finger. She also suffered neck and shoulder injuries. The injuries were classified as grievous because of the fracture Despite the fact that the doctor was the only witness, the proceedings dragged on for 17 years. A court minute dated March 28, 2008 indicated that the driver of the other car had claimed damages to the tune of €1700. That amount included court expenses. But what was most concerning was the fact that his name was not even mentioned in that court minute. Much less so did he testify, observed the magistrate when delivering judgment. Nor was there any receipt or a single scrap of documentary evidence to support his claim for damages. Yet, while the case dragged on, the accused made €300 payments to someone named Etienne Bugeja. He appeared to be a relative of the victim and was driving the car at the time of the crash. That fact was understood through the police current incident report which, however, was never confirmed on oath. The magistrate was “most astonished” by the fact that the court, as previously presided, had permitted such payments for damages allegedly caused to Bugeja’s car when the accused was never charged with causing damage to third party property but only for injuring the passenger. And although he claimed damages totalling €1700, Bugeja was never even formally identified in the court records. In light of such evidence and the circumstances of the case, the court cleared Gatt of the other charges whilst conditionally discharging him for 40 months over those charges he pleaded guilty to. When meting out punishment, the court took into consideration Gatt’s criminal record and the fact that the case had “inexplicably” dragged on for 17 years.

3827,Police issue 400 traffic charges and fines over Christmas period,"Police presence on Malta's roads saw officers issuing over 400 traffic charges and fines during the Christmas period, the Malta Police Force said on Wednesday.  In the ten days between December 22 and 31, police officers carried out 170 road checks, stopping 4,700 vehicles and issuing more than 400 fines.  Over 85 speeding tickets were issued thanks to gun inspections while 11 drivers tested positive during a breathalyser test.  Several vehicles were also towed due to having invalid or expired road licenses.  Police doing their rounds also distributed educational material on parked cars to discourage drunk driving.  Other infringements included drivers caught without a valid license, using mobile phones while driving and drivers not wearing seat belts.  ""These road inspections were coordinated by the Police Corps, with the assistance of officers from Transport Malta. This exercise of road inspections will not stop at the end of the New Year celebrations but will continue throughout the year to ensure safer roads in Malta and Gozo,"" a police spokesperson said.  ""The Police Corps thanks everyone for their cooperation, which has allowed us to have safe roads with no serious accidents during these festive days.""",01/01/2025,2025-07-03 15:12:43.810568+00,01/01/2025 0:00,FALSE,,,,,,,
3823,"Road safety bureau is a year late, with no clear way ahead","The transport ministry has declined to give a deadline by when the promised Transport Safety Investigative Commission will be set up. According to a government document released in April 2023, the bureau should have been up and running by the end of that year and was intended to help identify any shortcomings, issues and patterns to amend road safety policy. Currently, magisterial inquiries and police investigations are the only methods of investigating road accidents in Malta. Their conclusions generally remain confidential. A year after the target launch date, the bureau is still nowhere to be seen and it is unclear whether it is currently staffed. According to budget figures, the bureau spent around €15,000 in 2023, was allocated €120,000 in 2024 and will be given another €120,000 this year.  The delay has been condemned by victims’ families, insurers and doctors’ associations who said it is symptomatic of road safety not being given priority. The end of 2024 was marked by a series of serious traffic accidents. Dieter Vink, 54, was killed when his motorbike crashed into an unpermitted skip on the St Paul’s Bay bypass. Two days later, a 17-year-old girl was critically injured after being hit by a Jeep in Mellieħa, while a 29-year-old man sustained critical injuries after being hit by a car while replacing a flat tyre. On December 22, two motorcyclists were injured – one of them seriously – in a traffic accident on Triq is-Salini, which involved three motorbikes and a car.",01/01/2025,2025-07-03 15:12:42.70547+00,01/01/2025 0:00,FALSE,St Paul’s Bay bypass,St Paul's Bay,0,Fatal,Motorbike,54,M

Driving 15 km/h over the speed limit incurs a penalty of €100 and four penalty points on the offender’s licence. Police said that “appropriate legal action” was taken.

3743,Insurers demand roadside testing as drug-driving becomes 'a menace',"Drug-driving has become a menace on Malta's roads and the police should introduce roadside drug testing without delay, like they do for drink driving, the Insurance Association Malta said. In a statement it praised the police for mounting 170 road checks, inspecting 4,700 vehicles, and issuing more than 400 fines during the Christmas period. But it insisted that such measures should not be limited to the festive season.    “The risks associated with drink and drug-driving are not confined to the holiday season. Road safety should never be treated as a seasonal concern; it must remain a priority every single day,” the association stressed in a statement.   ""The fact that no serious traffic accidents were reported during this festive season was a testament to the effectiveness of these measures, it said.  “While we wholeheartedly support these actions, we must also express our disappointment that similar roadside checks and initiatives are not conducted consistently throughout the year — drivers choosing to endanger their lives and those of innocent road users should face robust and unrelenting deterrence year-round,” it said.  The association welcomed the use of breathalyser tests, which identified 11 drivers over the legal alcohol limit over the festive period, but it said tests should not be limited to drink-driving as drug-driving had become another menace on Malta’s roads. It therefore urged the police to embark on drug roadside testing – in addition to alcohol testing – without further delay. It also called for the urgent appointment of a long-promised Transport Safety Investigative Commission, which should have been up and running by the end of 2023. “We urge the authorities to take decisive action to uphold road safety, including the swift implementation of an accident investigation agency. As representatives of the insurance sector, we see firsthand the devastating consequences of road accidents, many of which could have been prevented through better enforcement and public education,” the association said.",06/01/2025,2025-07-03 15:12:21.635177+00,06/01/2025 0:00,FALSE,,,,,,,

Our number #99 will be deeply missed by all of us and also for sure by those who knew him,” Vittoriosa Stars said in a post on social media.  “Our thoughts and prayers are with his family during this difficult time. May he rest in peace.”   Lawyer Robert Thake said that while many were remembering Brincat for his success on the football pitch, little was being said about what a dedicated father he was.  ""Alejandro fought like hell - but with dignity - to spend as much time as he could with his daughter, and after over two years of fighting in court he finally got to spend Christmas Day with his daughter,"" he said.  He is survived by his daughters Ella and Kyra.",07/01/2025,2025-07-03 15:12:22.652517+00,06/01/2025 21:00,TRUE,Mdina road,Attard,1,Fatal,car,25,M

3653,Mother of road death victim calls out mistakes that lead to dropped court cases,"The mother of a 21-year-old man who died in a car crash has called out prosecution mistakes that lead to criminal court cases being dropped.  Fiona Laferla, whose son Ben died when the car his friend was driving crashed into a wall in Swieqi, said on Saturday that the indifference and callousness that family members of the deceased face in the justice system is another unnecessary wound in what is already a very difficult situation.  Speaking during Andrew Azzopardi’s radio show on RTK 103, Laferala said she cannot understand how those who make mistakes - like writing the wrong date, address or detail down at the scenes of crimes or crashes - don’t face any consequences for their actions.  “God forbid I made mistakes of this calibre while teaching, you would never hear the end of it,” she said.  “But isn’t it bad enough that you’ve lost a loved one, a husband or a child, and on a technicality you lose your chance to get closure as well?”  Laferla also criticised policymakers for not acting on what are clear shortcomings in the system. I worry that eventually, everyone becomes immune to these deaths until it impacts them,” she said.  “The worst thing that can strike you is indifference, and that is why I don’t understand the policymakers.”  She was also critical of the cold approach relatives are faced with when finding themselves in the court system.  “I saw this indifference first-hand in court with the first lawyer that (the driver of the car) had,” she continued.  “I’m a generally calm person but there was one occasion where I wanted to throw something at him. He tried to ridicule me, tried to paint Ben and his girlfriend in the worst light possible and was bringing up things that had nothing to do with the case at all.” Last year Maxime Asacha Muehlematter, the 22-year-old who was driving the car that Ben died in, admitted to causing his death and was handed a suspended sentence and a one-year driving ban. Muehlematter was cleared of drink-driving charges as prosecutors had no evidence to prove that charge. Initially another passenger in the car, a girl who was 17 at the time, told police she was the one driving the car.  The girl later admitted she had lied and that Muehlematter was the driver. She was given a conditional discharge.    Laferla told Times of Malta last year that while she was not out for revenge and did not want to see the young man go to prison, she felt that he should have received a longer driving ban, if barring him from driving forever was not a possibility.  Bringing this point up again on Saturday, she said that these are the issues policymakers should be addressing, particularly as road deaths are not isolated incidents and continue to claim people’s lives senselessly year after year.  “I knew that it was going to be a slap on the wrist because I had seen what happened in other cases,” she said.  “We were lucky that he admitted and the process was not long and drawn out. But when you’ve already lost your son that’s not saying much. Don’t the people on top see these things?” she questioned.",11/01/2025,2025-07-03 15:11:58.631504+00,24/09/2022 0:00,TRUE,Triq il-Madliena,Swieqi,1,Fatal,car,22,M

Their findings typically remain confidential, which has drawn criticism from various quarters. Victims’ families, insurers, and medical associations have condemned the delay in establishing the bureau, describing it as symptomatic of road safety being sidelined. During the press conference, Bonett also urged drivers to observe traffic rules and treat one another with respect. “We must ensure that such bureaus and road safety councils are needed as little as possible,” he said.",13/01/2025,2025-07-03 15:11:54.30228+00,13/01/2025 0:00,FALSE,,,,,,,
3615,"Traffic fines yield government €116,187,254 in 10 years as police warn motorists","Payment of traffic fines earned the government €116,187,254 in the space of 10 years, according to information tabled in parliament by Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri. He told Nationalist MP Ivan Bartolo in reply to a question that between 2013 and 2023 the authorities issued 3,583,847 tickets for a value of  €133,811,122. A total of 3,287,066 ticket fines were paid, with a value of €116,187,254. Fines issued last year had a value of €16,215,744, more than twice that of 2013, with both the the number of cars on the roads and the nature of fines having increased.  The minister said LESA is working to recover outstanding funds and has issued 241 warrants of seizure to recover funds, which even go back to 2002.   Police warn motorists to observe the rules Meanwhile the police in a statement on Monday evening said they were committed to enforcing traffic regulations in the interests of safety. Over Christmas and the first two weeks of the month hundreds of vehicles were stopped and fines were issued for those found breaking the law. Among them were 84 cases of overspeeding in the past two weeks, the police said.  ""Motorists are reminded about the importance of observing speed limits and other traffic regulations since disrespect for regulations can have serious consequences for the motorists themselves and other road users,"" the police said.",13/01/2025,2025-07-03 15:11:49.174673+00,13/01/2025 0:00,FALSE,,,,,,,
3626,Watch: Yellow weather warning as heavy rain batters Malta,"Heavy rain battered Maltese roads on Tuesday afternoon as the Meteorological Office issued a warning for thundery showers.  Footage sent to Times of Malta shows motorists struggling to drive in a torrential downpour in San Ġwann, with water levels lapping onto pavements and sinking several inches of car tyres.  Several motorists also reported heavy traffic building up in Gżira, Sliema and Kappara heading towards the south.   The Met Office warned that isolated thundery showers at times were expected to affect certain areas of the country.  The rest of the week is set to be characterised by stormy weather, as thundery showers are forecast for Tuesday and Wednesday.  On Wednesday, the country is set to experience Force 5 to 6 winds, later diminishing to Force 4 to 3. The Celsius is predicted to reach highs of 15°C with a low of 10°C forecast.   On Thursday, only isolated showers are predicted for the most part, but winds are set to pick up from Force 2 to 3 becoming a Force 4 to 5 later in the evening.  Friday is then set to be windy with isolated showers and a slight increase in temperature, with a forecast high of 17°C and a low of 13°C. Winds will remain at Force 5 to 6 early on Friday but are predicted to lower to Force 4 to 5.  The weather is forecast to stabilise over the weekend, with cloudy skies forecast on Saturday and Sunday.  If you have any images to share please email newsroom@timesofmalta.com",14/01/2025,2025-07-03 15:11:51.857217+00,14/01/2025 0:00,FALSE,,,,,,,
3604,Road safety strategy misses target to cut fatalities and serious injuries,"A road safety strategy launched a decade ago has failed to hit several of its targets, according to an analysis carried out by Times of Malta, as two road deaths in the early weeks of 2025 thrust road safety concerns back into the spotlight. On Monday 6 January, 25-year-old Alejandro Brincat was killed after he lost control of his car in Attard.   On the same day, a 24-year-old Nepalese woman, Gauri Kumari Baral, was hit by a pickup truck in Fgura. She died just a few days later. A decade after a landmark road safety strategy pledged to cut road fatalities by half, Times of Malta examines whether the strategy was a success. What did the strategy promise? Published in 2014, the road safety strategy set an ambitious target of reducing road fatalities by 50%, grievous traffic-related injuries by 30%, and slight injuries by a fifth. Authorities at the time argued that while Maltese roads were already safe compared to most other European countries, things could and should get better, with Malta still struggling to tackle issues like speeding and drunk driving. The strategy promised to improve road safety through a series of “strategic actions” aimed at addressing shortcomings in everything from enforcement to road engineering and education.  On the other hand, the number of slight injuries on the road does seem to be on the wane. While almost 1,500 people reported a slight injury after a traffic incident a decade ago, this is now down to a little over 1,100, a 23% drop, in line with the strategy's plans. More cars and more accidents With the sheer number of cars on Malta’s roads ballooning by the day (33 new cars each day, at last count), it’s no surprise to see that the total number of accidents is on the rise. There were some 16,500 traffic accidents reported in 2023, more than at any point over the previous two decades. But while there are far more cars on Malta’s roads today, the accident rate is a little lower than it once was. Back in 2014, there were 43 accidents for every 1,000 cars on the road. Today this is down to roughly 37. And fewer of these accidents result in injury these days, Of these 16,500 accidents in 2023, just one in ten resulted in an injury, fewer than in most previous years. The figures for the first nine months of 2024 are even lower, dropping to 9%. The last time the figure was this low was back in 2011, hovering around 12% for much of the past decade. Questions sent to the transport ministry and Transport Malta remain unanswered at the time of publication",15/01/2025,2025-07-03 15:11:46.166228+00,13/01/2025 0:00,FALSE,none,Attard,0,Fatal,car,25,M

3558,‘Don’t give up’: Isabelle Bonnici urges father seeking answers for son’s death,"Isabelle Bonnici, the mother of construction victim Jean Paul Sofia, has urged a Danish father seeking answers about his son's tragic death not to give up on advocating for his son.  Lars Neidhardt told Times of Malta that over a year since his son died in Malta in a traffic collision, he has been left in the dark by Maltese authorities.  Asger Emil Neidhard was a 25-year-old IT entrepreneur who came to Malta in October 2023 to enjoy a holiday with friends. Six days later, he died after he was hit by a Honda Accord driven by a 44-year-old man in the Regional Road tunnels. “Ten days after the accident, my son arrived in Denmark in a coffin, and we never heard from the Maltese authorities about what happened to him,” Neidhardt said.  “It’s very frustrating to lose one’s child and not know what happened. Is the case being investigated? Is the driver facing any consequences? We are completely left in the dark.”  While many commenters expressed solidarity with the father and others speculated that achieving justice would be a long and thankless journey that may not even be successful, one voice of encouragement stood out from the rest.  Bonnici urged Neidhardt not to give in to negativity and keep fighting to seek the truth about his son's death.  ""Don't give up on getting justice for your son! Keep voicing your frustration, keep emailing, get the media, do whatever it takes... just don't give up!"" she said.  ""Not giving up gives others the courage to fight for their rights!

3588,Danish father ‘left in the dark’ about son killed in car accident,"The father of a Danish man who died after being hit by a car in St Julian’s a year and a half ago has been left in the dark as to what happened the night his son died. Asger Emil Neidhardt, a 25-year-old IT entrepreneur, arrived in Malta on October 22, 2023, for a holiday with friends. Six days later, he died after he was hit by a Honda Accord driven by a 44-year-old man in the Regional Road tunnels. While a police spokesperson said the family had been provided with updates on the investigation and the ongoing magisterial inquiry, Neidhardt’s father disputed this claim. “Ten days after the accident, my son arrived in Denmark in a coffin, and we never heard from the Maltese authorities about what happened to him,” Lars Neidhardt told Times of Malta. “It’s very frustrating to lose one’s child and not know what happened. Is the case being investigated? Is the driver facing any consequences? We are completely left in the dark.” While details of the accident are scarce, Neidhardt was in touch with the friends who were the last to see Asger. That night the group had gone out, yet Asger did not return to his accommodation with the others. “His friends called and texted him during the night, but he never answered,” he said. The next morning, the group headed to the police station to report their missing friend. There, a police officer informed them about the accident and asked them to identify the body. They confirmed it was Asger. Later in the day, Asger’s mother received a call from the Maltese police informing her that her son was killed in a car accident. Neidhardt then found online media reports about his son’s death. “One minute he is out for dinner and drinks, and then the next thing I find out is that my son is dead,” Neidhardt said. Ten days later, Asger’s body arrived in Denmark. His father recalled how more than 300 people attended his funeral in Aabenraa, the town where he grew up. Countless calls and emails Following the funeral, the family contacted the Danish Embassy (based in Rome) to see how they could get more information on what happened to Asger. The ambassador advised them to contact the attorney general. Since Asger’s death, his father has sent eight emails to the attorney general and made countless phone calls, only to receive the same response each time: the magisterial inquiry has not yet been concluded. “It is now more than one year since my son died in Malta, and I still haven’t heard one word from the authorities in Malta,” Neidhardt wrote in his last email to the attorney general on December 6, 2024. “Please be informed that the inquiry is not yet concluded,” was the response he received. Neidhardt has started to question if anything has happened since the accident. “I am never informed how long I have to wait for an update or if the case is still under investigation. Nothing.”  In a reply to questions regarding the magisterial inquiry, a police spokesperson said while the inquiry is still ongoing the family have been updated on the investigations. “While the investigating officer communicates with the family since the victim’s family resides abroad, they have been updated about the investigations and the inquiry through the Danish Consulate,” the spokesperson said. Neidhardt confirmed the family were never in touch with the authorities, nor did the Consulate reach out to them. “We have heard absolutely nothing.” ‘Spread joy because of his positive attitude’ Neidhardt recalled how his son loved life and enjoyed travelling around Europe with friends for new experiences. “He was a very caring, loving and funny young man, he loved his family and friends above all,” he said. “He spread joy in the family and his surroundings because of his positive attitude and energy.” The last time Lars saw his son was two weeks before he died, during a family weekend trip at a summer house. “I hugged him in the driveway before he drove off back home. I still can’t believe that I will never see him again.” This is not the first time that family members have raised questions about Maltese authorities following an incident. In 2016, Mike Mansholt, a 17-year-old who came to Malta on holiday, was found dead at the foot of Dingli Cliffs. The Maltese magisterial inquiry concluded that Mike had died of natural causes and police closed the case. While the Maltese and German post-mortem concluded that the teenager had no broken bones, the Medical University of Hanover uncovered that Mike was devoid of the heart, brain, neck organs, lungs, liver, pancreas, adrenal glands, right kidney, bladder, stomach and the small intestine.

3563,Drivers fume as large pothole leaves trail of flat tyres in Iklin,"More than a dozen cars sustained flat tyres on Friday afternoon after heavy rains carved out a massive pothole on a busy road.

Drivers are getting out of their cars, furious,” one motorist said, describing the chaotic scene. One driver counted at least 12 cars sustaining flat tyres though he was sure others had simply driven on not realising the damage. Despite calls to the authorities to repair the pothole or divert traffic, no action had been taken by 4.30pm, leaving hundreds of drivers to navigate the treacherous road or rely on sheer luck.  A motorist claimed the pothole had been present for weeks, but Friday’s heavy rain worsened the damage, while the flowing water concealed the hazard from drivers.

Following a magisterial inquiry into the case, several people had been charged over the incident. These were MFCC directors Chris Vassallo, Nazzareno Vassallo and Gerald Borg, CEO Anita Mifsud and projects manager Mark Anthony Farrugia.  They pleaded not guilty to involuntarily causing serious injuries to worker Emanuel Ronayne through their negligence. They were also charged with involuntarily causing slight injuries to other workers, causing damages to Nexos Ltd and RVC Ltd and breaching the Occupational Health and Safety Act.  Magistrate Caroline Farrugia Frendo heard how, on the day, workers were fixing lighting and other cables onto a metal arch ahead of the rock concert. The metal arch collapsed. Ronayne was passing some cables when it happened and he felt a “sudden massive blow” that resulted in him suffering from perforated lungs, a ruptured spleen, fractured ribs on his left side as well as fractures to several vertebrae.  The magistrate heard several witnesses testify how the arch had been put in place in 2006. It was used to affix lighting and screens and could be moved around depending on the needs of the event being organised. It moved on wheels that ran on rails and had to be dragged with fork lifters. The same procedure of moving the arch had been used since it was set up. A couple of days before the incident the arch had been moved according to the needs of the rock concert. Usually, lighting was then fixed according to an approved plan agreed on by Nexos, RVC and MFCC and under the supervision of an architect. In this case, the approved plan had not yet been supplied and the architect had not been appointed to supervise the works. The magistrate ruled that, although responsible for the company, this did not mean that the accused were criminally responsible for anything that happened there. She also noted that, according to court expert Alex Torpiano, the collapse was the result of three factors: the unbalanced loading of the arch, the way the arch was moved, and the contact between the arch’s wheels and the concrete floor. It was not clear if one or all of these factors had caused the accident. Since the exact cause of the accident could not be pinned down, the court could not attribute blame to the directors of the MFCC or any of its workers. Lawyer Joe Giglio represented the Vassallos, Borg and Mifsud while lawyer Patrick Valentino appeared for Farrugia.",22/01/2025,2025-07-03 15:11:14.01184+00,22/01/2025 0:00,FALSE,,,,,,,
3443,Former finance minister proposes extended school hours for activities,"Former Finance Minister Tonio Fenech has suggested extending school hours — not for teaching, but to incorporate extracurricular activities into the education system. Appearing on the program Il-Każin fuq Tokis, set to air on Friday, Fenech discussed how schools could better utilise their facilities after normal hours.  ""We have invested a lot in schools,"" Fenech said, emphasising that school sports facilities often lay unused after the school day ends. He explained that children often leave school, complete their homework at home then head out again for extracurricular activities. This arrangement, he said, creates unnecessary traffic as parents ferry their children to different locations for activities. “Why don’t we focus all that energy on extending the school hours — but not on teachers?” Fenech explained. He proposed that teachers would not be expected to take on additional responsibilities, but instead extracurricular educators such as football and tennis coaches and dance and drama instructors would be used instead. ""Why don’t they become an integrated part of the educational system? That way, instead of children running around everywhere, they would be focused in one place,"" he added. Fenech suggested that after-school hours could also be used for children to complete their homework, ensuring they have more quality time with their families when they get home. He argued this would also align school and work hours, making life easier for parents and potentially reducing traffic. While noting that the Malta Union of Teachers (MUT) had previously opposed his proposal, however, Fenech did not discuss the reasons for the union’s rejection during the discussion.  The debate surrounding school hours has gained traction following a recent study by the National Commission for the Promotion of Equality (NCPE) which highlighted the “marked incompatibility” between Malta’s short school hours and the typical eight-hour workday.  The NCPE noted that Malta’s school opening hours are among the shortest in the EU. In 2011, Roger Murphy, a professor of education at the University of Nottingham, told Times of Malta that Maltese students spend significantly less time in school compared to students in other developed countries. The MUT has disputed this claim. Last week, Education Minister Clifton Grima commented on the topic, saying: ""The education system should revolve around children's well-being. If we prioritise other things, we would be making a mistake."" Grima emphasised the importance of family time in a child’s development, noting that children should be able to spend quality time at home. Fenech’s proposal remains one of several ideas being floated to address the issue.",23/01/2025,2025-07-03 15:11:04.714187+00,17/01/2025 0:00,FALSE,,,,,,,

3410,Do local councils have the authority to issue tow zone notices for events?,"An investigation by the ombudsman has raised questions on the enforceability of notices about tow zones issued by local councils for specific events in their locality.  The case centres around a woman who had her car towed after leaving it in an area with parking restrictions starting at 7pm.  Her car ended up being towed away at 2.30pm, several hours before the restrictions started, due to “conflicting notices”.  Notices at the parking area indicated the tow zone would begin at 7pm, however other notices affixed near flyers for an event organised by a local council indicated an earlier time of 2pm.  The 7pm notice was issued by a local council, that was not named in the ombudsman’s report, following a notification about the parking restrictions published in the Government Gazette.  According to traffic regulations, the ombudsman said, only the commissioner of police or Transport Malta can issue temporary traffic orders for specific events.  The investigation highlights that local councils lack the legal authority to issue notices for events with the same enforceable power as the police or Transport Malta.  The local council admitted to organising the event and affixing the tow zone signs, however conflicting notices at the site created confusion, the ombudsman said.  It was concluded that the woman was unfairly penalised due to inconsistent notices and administrative oversights by the local council.   This issue appears to be separate from a 2022 court ruling deeming it illegal for private individuals to fix tow zone signs on a property, as this should only be done by a government entity. The following year, the law was changed, allowing applicants to affix tow zone signs issued by a local council.",24/01/2025,2025-07-03 15:10:55.818553+00,24/01/2025 19:00,FALSE,,,,,,,

3218,‘His body wasn’t in one piece’: relatives recall Um El Faroud blast 30 years on,"Mary Grace Sciberras will never forget the harrowing scene she saw in hospital 30 years ago, after her family was awoken in the middle of the night and told their father, Angelo, had been “slightly injured” at work. “When we arrived in hospital someone approached my brother and asked him whether he could recognise our father. They told us he had, in fact, died,” Sciberras, then a young woman in her early twenties, recalled. “I will never forget the scene I saw that day. His body was not in one piece.” Angelo was one of nine dockyard workers killed in a powerful explosion at the then state-owned Malta Drydocks 30 years ago – a tragedy that will remain one of the darkest chapters in Malta’s industrial history and one of the worst workplace tragedies since the war.  But for Sciberras, Seguna and the relatives of those who perished, the pain remains raw even after three decades. Following the inquiry, the structurally damaged Um El Faroud was deemed a total loss and the decision was made to scuttle the ship off the southern coast as an artificial reef and diving attraction. Today, the wreck serves as a popular destination for divers, while a memorial plaque on the ship pays tribute to the nine workers who lost their lives. Paola’s Christ the King Basilica, where the massive funeral was held for all victims 30 years ago, will be celebrating a mass for the repose of the souls of the victims Monday (today) at 6.30pm.

He described how he was stonewalled by the police and the attorney general as he tried to get information on the progress of any investigation into the death. The Maltese police informed Neidhardt last Friday that the magisterial inquiry into his son’s death had been concluded and that the driver would be charged in court. “I am glad that we finally received some information about what happened,” Neidhardt told Times of Malta.

The current magisterial inquiries law contains a provision saying that inquiries should be completed within 60 days. However, this provision is often ignored and a new bill proposed by the government will extend this to six months. But magistrates will now have a hard two-year deadline to complete their work.

3076,Maltese woman left with head and spinal injuries after Mount Etna sled accident,"A 47-year-old Maltese woman suffered spinal injuries and a severe head injury on Sunday after slipping off a sled inside a crater of Sicily's Mount Etna, according to Italian media. The woman, who suffered bruises and abrasions all over her body, was rescued from the Silvestri crater by members of the Sicilian Alpine and Speleological Rescue (CNSAS) from Etna’s south station, Italian media said. She was rescued from the slopes by stretcher and taken to the edge of the crater before being transferred to a hospital by ambulance, after unfavourable weather conditions including fog and heavy snowfall prevented evacuation by helicopter. The woman was taken to Cannizzaro Hospital in Catania for further treatment. Her rescue was not the only one to take place Sunday; local media said a woman from Augusta suffered a suspected hand fracture after also falling from a sled, while a 49-year-old woman from Milazzo was rescued after falling ill. The Silvestri Craters are a popular tourist destination and among the most visited parts of the Mount Etna, located just below the top of the volcano on its southeastern slope. Questions have been sent to the foreign ministry.",10/02/2025,2025-07-03 15:09:28.710369+00,09/02/2025 0:00,FALSE,,,,,,,

2975,‘We are utterly disgusted. But this is Malta’: crash victim parents in the dark,"The parents of a motorcyclist killed in a horror crash with an unpermitted skip say they have been left in the dark, with the authorities failing to provide updates or press charges two months later.  Anthony Holmes, 80, and his wife, Patricia, 79, spoke to Times of Malta from the home of their late son, Dieter Vink, where they were still sorting their son’s belongings. “No one has been in touch at all,” said Vink’s mother, noting there had been complete silence from the authorities since her husband and their son’s close friend, Juliette Johnson, collected his personal items. “We are extremely disappointed that things haven’t moved on,” she added.  Anthony Holmes went further: “It is more than disappointing. We are utterly disgusted. But I learnt this is Malta.” , police would have been on this like white on rice and probably would have charged whoever is responsible by now,” said Vink’s father.  The couple, originally from Yorkshire, England, said that such obstacles in a UK street would have seen half a mile of cones and warning lights to divert traffic.  “There was nothing for our son to see. It is too relaxed in Malta, and it feels like health and safety doesn’t exist here,” he added. Footage of the crash’s aftermath sparked widespread anger on social media, with many calling for accountability, citing alleged negligence by the contractor. Multiple sources informed Times of Malta that JV Infrastructure was responsible for the skip, but repeated attempts to contact the company were unsuccessful. 'I don’t even want to get out of bed' A magisterial inquiry is ongoing, but the lack of communication and updates has deeply affected Vink’s family and friends.  Clutching a locket containing a strand of her son’s hair, his mother admitted: “I don’t even want to get out of bed most days anymore.” She recalled her fond memories of Malta, where she lived as a child while her father worked with the Royal Air Force. For decades, the couple had vacationed here yearly, often staying up to 90 days post-Brexit. What was once a “home away from home” has changed forever.  “At first, I swore I would never return, but his ashes are here, and I want to maintain a connection to him in some way,” Patricia Holmes said.  As they prepare to return to the UK, Vink’s parents are already planning their return in a few months for a vigil in their son’s honour and hope to plant freesias in the small park near his home. “Like that, we can sit and talk to him,” his mother said. For now, they believe these small acts offer a semblance of closure. But, they stress, it is far from enough and demand justice for their son.",16/02/2025,2025-07-03 15:09:00.691832+00,11/12/2024 17:00,TRUE,St Paul’s Bay bypass,St Paul’s Bay,1,Fatal,Motorbike,54,M

2959,"Higher purity, cocaine-related deaths spark lab concerns","Updated 12.50pm A forensic laboratory is raising alarm over the rising purity of cocaine, which is increasingly linked to a growing number of drug-related deaths. Cocaine was the most common drug found in post-mortem toxicology reports in 2024, according to data gathered by the Forensic Analysis Laboratory (FAL).  The FAL also found lidocaine which acts as a local anaesthetic which is used to “trick the user” as it creates a numbing effect, that is usually attributed to greater cocaine purity. The laboratory also found that a substance called pink cocaine or tucibi has garnered a lot of popularity, but it does not share any resemblance to traditional cocaine. “It is a compound derived from a mixture of MDMA, amphetamine, LSD, and other synthetic drugs, resulting in a potent and unpredictable substance,” the report said. Cannabis NGO reacts Reacting, cannabis NGO ReLeaf said cannabis use has increased in Malta and the presence of the drug remained in the bloodstream for weeks and months, irrespective of impairment levels. “Therefore, when considering these two important aspects and the fact that tests were carried out postmortem, it is very difficult to reach conclusions if the detection of cannabis in the bloodstream is correlated to the actual accident,” ReLeaf said. It added that data from the NSO and other reputable institutions showed that overspeeding and mobile use were more directly linked to fatal traffic accidents.",17/02/2025,2025-07-03 15:08:56.335959+00,17/02/2025 0:00,FALSE,,,,,,,
2927,Traffic gridlock is Malta's biggest problem: Times of Malta poll,"Updated 1.26pm with PN statement. Malta’s traffic woes are now the country’s biggest problem, according to a new Times of Malta poll, narrowly edging out other concerns such as the cost of living, over-construction and corruption. The poll finds that when asked to name Malta’s biggest problem, 28% of respondents pointed to the country’s ongoing struggle with traffic, parking and public transport. This is the first time that traffic tops the list, which was typically been the domain of cost of living concerns in recent years. Traffic is also mentioned as one of the top concerns for individuals, with 15% saying that it is the issue that troubles them most on an individual basis. The findings come as the government mulls the introduction of a host of measures aimed at cutting down on congestion. But recent data suggests that transport minister Chris Bonett has his work cut out, with 27 new vehicles being added to Malta’s roads each day. Cost of living worries dip but still linger Despite the dip in inflation over the past year, with Europe’s cost-of-living crisis seemingly in the rearview mirror, the poll suggests that cost of living remains a major concern for many people. Cost of living is listed as the country’s second-biggest problem, narrowly trailing traffic, with 27% of respondents saying that it is the issue that Malta most needs to address. But this nonetheless represents a dip from previous polls, in which it often topped the list with well over a third of respondents saying it was Malta’s biggest concern. And the rising cost of living remains the issue that most impacts people on an individual level, with one in five saying that it is their biggest personal struggle, more than any other issue.  And, unlike most other previous polls, in which people of almost all ages listed corruption as one of the country’s top concerns, only respondents over the age of 65 listed it amongst Malta’s top three problems this time around. The poll, carried out by market research firm Esprimi, surveyed 600 people between January 30 and February 12. PN reacts: Transport one of government's biggest failures In a reaction to the survey findings, the Nationalist Party said it confirmed that transport was one of the government's biggest failures. ""Almost four years ago, just a few months before a general election, Labour presented the Metrò project, spending more than €2 million of taxpayers’ money on it. As soon as the election was over, they scrapped it. Robert Abela and his colleagues always knew they were never going to implement this project, yet they were comfortable wasting public money just to make people believe they were going to solve all the problems. They misled the public using their own money,"" the party said.  ""Now, we are facing a situation where traffic is not only creating frustration and anger but is also leading to stress and anxiety. In addition, traffic is increasing air pollution in our country, negatively impacting our health and causing further economic damage."" The party reiterated its promises for the sector, including an efficient mass transport system, a stronger infrastructure, well planned roadworks, and incentives for those who choose to give up their car for a number of years in favour of alternative transport. Mark Anthony Sammut, shadow minister for transport, signed the statement.",18/02/2025,2025-07-03 15:08:48.367291+00,18/02/2025 0:00,FALSE,,,,,,,

The Kacey Sciberras Garden, located near Piscopo Cash and Carry in St Paul’s Bay, was opened by Environment Minister Miriam Dalli and the St Paul’s Bay Local Council. Sciberras died in a crash on the Central Link road in Attard when the Chevrolet Aveo she was riding in lost control. She died on the spot. St Paul’s Bay mayor Censu Galea explained that the idea for the garden was first proposed by the previous council before last year’s election. “She was so active in the local festa committee that the council wanted to dedicate part of the garden to her,” Galea said. He added that after he became mayor, and with the help of Project Green, they managed to expand the space dedicated to Sciberras. Sciberras was an active member of her local festa committee, Kumitat Żgħażagħ Ġawħrin. The mayor praised her commitment to the community. “Let’s hope her memory will inspire other young people to engage in community activities.” Sciberras was also a student at the Institute of Tourism Studies (ITS) and served as the student council president. Sandra Gauci, a St Paul’s Bay councillor, used the occasion to highlight the need for greater road safety measures in Malta. “This could have been avoided if we had more seriousness and discipline on our roads,” she said. “It is our duty as politicians to protect people on the road as much as possible,” she added.",20/02/2025,2025-07-03 15:08:34.884276+00,20/02/2025 0:00,FALSE,Central Link road,Attard,0,Fatal,Car,none,none

2452,"Driver injured after his truck overturns in Rabat, load spilled across road","Updated: 3.30pm A truck driver was grievously injured when his vehicle overturned, spilling an entire load of construction sand across the road near Mdina on Friday morning. The accident happened on Triq Buqana in Rabat at around 10am. The spillage caused both carriageways of the main road leading to Mġarr to be closed to traffic. The driver of the DAC truck - a 35-year-old man from Marsascala - was taken to hospital by ambulance.  In a Facebook post, Transport Malta announced it had closed the road in both directions until the vehicle and the sand were cleared away.  ROTA urges segregation of high-speed traffic, bicycles  In a statement on Friday afternoon, bicycle advocacy group ROTA said the crash flagged the urgent need for better road safety measures, particularly for bicycle users. The truck, the NGO said, ended up within the bicycle lane, where, had there been a bicycle user, they could have been fatally injured. ""The current road design offers no protection for cyclists, and this tragic event highlights the pressing need for proper segregation between high-speed traffic and vulnerable road users, particularly those on bicycles,"" ROTA said. The need for protected bicycle lanes is not just a local issue - the matter has also been flagged in international road safety guidelines such as the CROW guidelines. These guidelines emphasise the importance of segregation in high-speed areas and the need for roads that are forgiving of human error, the group noted. ""In simple terms, we must ensure that the consequences of mistakes – whether made by a driver or a cyclist – are not fatal. Sadly, Malta is still without a legally binding national cycling policy that will outline clear standards for the design and implementation of safe and effective bicycle lanes. ""We cannot allow cyclists to be subjected to what is, at best, a makeshift effort that often amounts to nothing more than a splash of green paint and some rumble strips. It is not enough. Bicycle lanes need to be designed to protect cyclists – physically separated from traffic in high-speed areas, with sufficient space and barriers to prevent accidents.""",14/03/2025,2025-07-03 15:06:49.726435+00,14/03/2025 10:00,TRUE,Triq Buqana,Rabat,1,Grievious,Van,35,M

2271,"Car drivers to be offered €25,000 to give up licence for five years","The government plans to pay drivers €25,000 if they give up their licence for five years, Times of Malta is informed. Aimed at reducing the number of cars on Malta’s roads, the measure is expected to be announced soon alongside a number of other such policies. Licence holders who own a car and have been driving in Malta for at least seven years will be offered €5,000 a year for five years in exchange for giving up their licence.       Drivers who have a change of heart and decide they want their licence back during that time will have to pay an undisclosed penalty to do so.  The measure will only apply to owners of passenger cars – meaning motorbikes, commercial vans and other such vehicles will be excluded – and will apply to all car-owning drivers with seven years of experience, irrespective of age.  While policymakers privately acknowledge that they would like Maltese citizens to be the primary beneficiaries, anyone who qualifies will be eligible. Cabinet has already approved the measure but some of its detail is still being fleshed out, sources said.  One aspect which has yet to be clarified is what form the payment to applicants will take. Payments could be made in the form of cash grants, which would bump up government expenditure, or tax rebates, which would instead reduce government income.  Nevertheless, government sources said they are keen to introduce the measure this year.  The policy is among those forming the first phase of traffic-reducing measures pledged by Transport Minister Chris Bonett. Measures will continue to be rolled out across an 18-month period and are expected to cost tens of millions of euros in total.   Malta’s problem with traffic is well-documented and official statistics lay out the extent of the problem.   As of the end of last year, there were 445,711 registered motor vehicles in Malta. Over 70 per cent of those, 313,665, were private cars, National Statistics Office data shows – a 20 per cent increase over the same figure a decade earlier, in 2014.  While the government has invested extensively in road infrastructure and subsidies to make public buses free of charge in the past years, attempts to limit the growing flow of traffic have been otherwise limited.  A much-promoted report into a metro system unveiled in 2021 proved to be a pre-electoral red herring and suggestions of dissuading drivers by introducing unpopular measures such as parking fees or congestion charges – or removing subsidies on fuel – have been shot down.  Offering drivers a cash incentive to turn in their licence is an unusual policy move, with few parallels globally. Far more common are car scrappage schemes, in which drivers are offered a cash or tax incentive to scrap old vehicles in favour of newer, less polluting ones. Malta has had such a scheme in place for years.   Policymakers admit that the €25,000 incentive will not be a silver bullet to solve traffic woes but argue that it is part of a broader series of measures intended to get cars off the road.  In an extensive interview last autumn, Bonett had also suggested finding ways of encouraging young people to not get a licence in the first place, increasing the use of ferries and introducing a new category of licence plate that would restrict drivers to using those vehicles at set days or times.  Soon after, Bonett formally unveiled several traffic-busting ideas for public feedback. The measures span all aspects of transportation, from cycling strategy documents to plans to overhaul Malta’s public bus routes and are focused on incentivising behavioural change rather than punishing road users, the minister said.",23/03/2025,2025-07-03 15:06:03.938429+00,23/03/2025 0:00,FALSE,,,,,,,
2285,"Sceptical response to offer of €25,000 to ditch driving licence","A government plan to offer €25,000 to people who give up their driving licence has had a largely sceptical reaction from both experts and the public. The money could be much better spent on other initiatives to reduce traffic, a transport expert said yesterday. “We know how to shift people away from cars,” Suzanne Maas, who holds a PhD in sustainable mobility, said. “Safer walking infrastructure, frequent crossings, protected bicycle paths, more shade, more frequent public transport, and possibly a bus rapid transit system are all ways to get people away from cars.” Removing Malta’s generous fuel subsidies would also disincentivise car use, she said. Those solutions, however, would mean taking space away from cars and irking car owners, added Maas, who is also Friends of the Earth’s climate campaign coordinator. “That is something the government seems unwilling to do, so they would rather just throw money at the problem. “To bring changes, you cannot only use the carrot; you need the stick as well. The solutions might not be popular at the start, but they work,” she said. On Sunday, Times of Malta reported that the government plans to pay drivers €25,000 if they give up their licence for five years. Sources said that licence holders who own a car and have been driving in Malta for at least seven years will be offered €5,000 a year for five years. The measure is expected to be announced soon alongside a number of other such policies designed to reduce traffic on Malta’s congested roads. Like Maas, Jonathan Sammut, an MCAST lecturer and alternative mobility activist, called for more disincentives as a way of doing so. “If the government wants to promote alternative means of commuting and discourage use of personal cars, anyone who studied economics ‒ even if just at O level ‒ would say that the first thing that would need to be done is to remove the subsidies on fuel. You don’t subsidise something that you want people to make less use of,” he said. Others, including Adrian Galea, who heads Malta’s insurers’ lobby, questioned whether the €25,000 handout would only entice people who have already stopped driving. He asked whether all licence holders, irrespective of age, usage and so on, would qualify, and what controls the authorities intend putting in place to curb any abuse. “What matters most is that this measure is not considered as a path to easy money by selling or giving up your licence when the licence holder seldom uses the car or wasn’t a user anyway. It would be very difficult to ascertain this as data is probably lacking,” Galea said. He added that effective enforcement would be needed for the policy to succeed in taking cars off the road, comparing it to the government’s lack of willingness to tackle drunk and drug driving. “We are now being bombarded with reports about the [easy] availability of drugs ‒ not just cannabis ‒ which sadly is another concern on top of alcohol consumption before driving. It is very clear that the government’s apathy or unwillingness at tackling this issue will continue to have its effect on road safety. “Introducing measures such as this exchange of licences for payments will only succeed if properly enforced.” Meanwhile, most commenters on social media and the Times of Malta comments board expressed doubts over the plan. “I would have imposed a limit on drivers over 65 years of age, since these are already potentially not going to work on a daily basis and thus are not the major contributors to traffic, especially during peak hours,” K. Zahra said. “So I get €25,000, drive without the licence and when I get caught, I’ll pay the fine,” another woman commented on Instagram. Others said that before ditching their private car, suitable alternatives are needed. “I’m ready to do it… but the public transport needs to be up to standard. If the bus says it will pass at 12:10, it needs to pass at 12:10.” Others pointed out the initiatives would mostly benefit non-Maltese residents who decide to go home after receiving the money. Among them was former PN shadow transport minister Adrian Delia. “So foreign drivers who have been around for seven years will get a smashing bonus of €25,000 to go back home,” Delia, who had the health portfolio in the PN’s shadow cabinet last year, said. Malta’s problem with traffic is well-documented and official statistics lay out the extent of the problem.  As of the end of last year, there were 445,711 registered motor vehicles on the islands. Over 70% of those, 313,665, were private cars, National Statistics Office data show. This is a 20% increase over the same figure a decade earlier.  While the government has invested extensively in road infrastructure and subsidies to make public buses free of charge in the past years, attempts to limit the growing flow of traffic have been otherwise limited.  A much-promoted report into a metro system unveiled in 2021 proved to be a pre-electoral red herring and suggestions of dissuading drivers by introducing unpopular measures such as parking fees or congestion charges – or removing subsidies on fuel – have been shot down.",24/03/2025,2025-07-03 15:06:07.352625+00,,FALSE,,,,,,,

2137,"17-year-olds to be offered €6,000 to defer driving licence until 21","Teens who choose not to get a car driving licence until they turn 21 and ride a scooter instead could receive a €6,000 cash grant, under a plan being explored by the government.   Sources close to the Transport Ministry told Times of Malta that the measure - first revealed by Malta Today earlier on Friday - is another in a series of incentives being planned to ease traffic on roads.  If enacted, the proposal would see 17-year-olds eligible for a €1,500-per-year grant if they renounce the opportunity to sit for a car driving licence until they turn 21.  To ensure they can still be mobile, authorities would like to reduce the minimum driving age for scooters to 17, in line with a Brussels-approved plan to revise EU-wide driving rules to allow member states to lower minimum driving ages.  The plan is to allow teenagers who apply for the €1,500 grant to sit for and obtain a scooter licence.   It is the second grant-focused incentive being mulled to reduce traffic.  On Sunday, Times of Malta reported that driving licence holders who own a car and have been driving in Malta for at least seven years will be offered a €25,000 incentive to give up their licence for a five-year period.   Authorities are still ironing out details of that plan but say there will be strict penalties for anyone who applies for that scheme but then has a change of heart during the five-year period.   Bonett had hinted at some of the measures in an interview with Times of Malta in September 2024, including increasing the use of ferries and introducing a rapid bus transit system.  Back then, he said the government was mulling measures that would allow people to forfeit their driving licence for a financial incentive and disincentivise young people from learning to drive. He also said he would not be implementing any of the incentives until at least April because “we must get this right”. The following month, Times of Malta revealed that the government was also planning on introducing a park-and-ride system to ease congestion in areas known as severe traffic hot spots.

2101,Driver jailed for four years for killing passenger in 2017 car crash,"A 48-year-old man has been jailed for four years for causing the death of a passenger in his car during a collision in August 2017. St Paul’s Bay resident Godfrey Gambin was charged with the involuntary homicide of Jane Mary Turner, 45. He was also accused of causing involuntary bodily harm on another driver, causing damages to the other car and violating traffic rules. Police sergeant Denise Camilleri told the court that she was stationed at Mosta Police Station on August 20 2017 when she got the call about a collision on Triq Sir Temi Zammit in Mġarr. The sergeant went on site and found Gambin’s car had overturned, the driver was standing outside and had blood over him. Turner, who was inside Gambin’s car, died on site. The other vehicle was on the pavement in the opposite direction. Gambin was hospitalised and was in intensive care for some time. The other driver told the court that he was going to Għadira and was driving towards Mġarr when he saw an oncoming car coming in the opposite direction in his lane. He had no time to avoid the collision and Gambin crashed his vehicle into the man’s car.  The vehicle spun twice before ending up on the pavement. The windscreen shattered. The driver recalled that when he got out of his car, he found Gambin’s car overturned and the female passenger dead on site. The court, presided over by magistrate Caroline Farrugia Frendo, found Gambin guilty and jailed him for four years.

2092,Architects urge 10-year inspections after two balconies collapse in a week,"The Kamra tal-Periti has renewed its call for buildings to be inspected for structural issues every 10 years after two separate balconies collapsed last week. The first collapse happened in Qawra in the early hours of Monday morning, just two hours after the owner of a popular bar on Imrejkba Street had called last orders and closed for the night.  The balcony of the third-floor apartment fell onto the second-floor apartment’s balcony, causing both to crash down onto the bar’s terrace below. Two days later, a stone balcony in Żabbar collapsed onto the pavement below. No one was injured in either incident. The block where the Qawra collapse occurred is located next door to a construction site where 39 apartments and 33 garages are being developed. Following the collapse, the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) issued a stop works notice for the site. However, the notice was reversed soon after and works were allowed to continue. On Thursday, the BCA confirmed that after a professional assessment, it had deemed that work on the site was not responsible for the collapse of the balconies.  The architect said regular inspections were part of a wider overhaul of the regulatory processes and standards involved in the building and construction industry that the chamber had been working on. Point 10 of these proposals calls for “post-occupancy checks and audits to be undertaken as pre-determined by the Building and Construction Authority to ensure the continued compliance of the structure with building regulations”. Such checks, Pizzuto said, could also include compliance with fire safety regulations, as well as the electrical wiring and lifts of a property. “How often these checks occur, and whether they are also carried out on existing buildings is something the government would have to decide on. Ultimately, it has to weigh the cost of carrying out such inspections against the risk of further collapses,” he said, adding that disused buildings and those located near the sea should be checked even more frequently.",01/04/2025,2025-07-03 15:05:18.679446+00,27/03/2025 0:00,FALSE,,,,,,,
2087,"Maximum 2,500 cars off the road in €15m cash-for-licences plan","Government plans to offer money in exchange for motorists giving up their car licence could mean a maximum of 2,500 fewer drivers on the road this year, according to experts. The figure equates to less than one per cent of all driving licences issued in Malta, according to figures provided in parliament two years ago. Last week, Transport Minister Chris Bonett announced a slew of measures to tackle the perennial issue of traffic blighting Malta’s roads. Among the measures were plans to offer €25,000 to motorists willing to give up their car for five years and €6,000 to those opting to ride a motorcycle instead for four years. But experts Times of Malta spoke to expressed doubts in the effectiveness of the licence measures – and others floated by the ministry. Bonett told reporters that the government intended to spend between €10 and €15 million to implement all the various measures being planned, which also include new bus routes, grants for motorcycles and carpooling tax incentives. A Transport Ministry spokesperson on Tuesday stressed the €15 million budget “refers to the allocation for the measures being implemented and paid for till the end of this year”. He said, “It does not take into account additional initiatives currently under discussion where key variables still need to be finalised and costed,” adding the government was “committed towards instilling a culture change in the transport sector”. Assuming the maximum amount is allocated and that all that money is allocated to people who choose to swap cars for motorcycles, 2,500 car drivers will be taken off the road. The figure was calculated by dividing the total €15 million budget by the €6,000 cost of incentivising a driver to exchange their car for a motorbike for four years. Just 600 car drivers taken off roads Transport academic Suzanne Maas noted that if that €15 million budget is used on the €25,000 incentive for drivers, just 600 car drivers will be taken off Maltese roads. “And that’s if they allocate the entire €15 million to the licences,” she said. “If they allocate only a third of the budget, that would only be 200 drivers... Is that going to make much of a difference?” She added it was unrealistic to expect the government to spend the entire budget on licensing measures, given that other measures in the proposals will also require funding to put into practice. “The licence scheme will take so much money and have little effect... It’s so much money given to so few people,” said Maas.  He said Pembroke – one of the areas slated for a park and ride – had been earmarked for such use “for years now, but it’s been a total failure”. And he questioned whether government sites would have enough spaces to accommodate public parking. Expressing doubts on shifting services to off-peak hours, he noted that, even if rubbish was collected at night, for example, “people, especially in touristic areas, will still be walking past bags of rubbish when out for an evening walk”. ‘Drastic measures’ Meanwhile, questioning the effectiveness of measures to improve take-up of public transport, Galea asked why traffic did not appear to have reduced following transport becoming free.   Asked whether his locality would be able to free up parking spaces for motorbikes, the St Paul’s Bay mayor said there were already “many more vehicles than car parking spaces available” in the busy tourist location.   “Unless we talk about drastic measures – which no government seems willing to do – we can’t get far on this”.  Asked about which drastic measures he could be referring to, Galea suggested looking into the possibility of limiting the number of cars with one person inside entering Valletta – in a bid to encourage carpooling – and said paid parking spaces could disincentivise car use. Pedestrianised streets and banning SUVs Maas, who holds a PhD in sustainable mobility from the University of Malta, noted that while “some measures are good” she expressed doubts about those focused on creating more parking spaces, stressing such measures instead “invited car use”. The academic noted that high streets only open to buses and pedestrians were “very common abroad” and said consumers were less likely to frequent areas with more cars, noting that removing cars from some areas could increase commercial high street activity. Maas – a Friends of the Earth Malta campaign organiser – said the government should consider limiting the number of cars per household and “definitely” limit the number of cars nationwide. She also called for a ban on large vehicles such as SUVs. “Restrictions are definitely needed,” said Maas.",02/04/2025,2025-07-03 15:05:17.464297+00,01/04/2025 0:00,FALSE,,,,,,,

The list does not include traffic fines issued by police and LESA. Data provided to parliament by Transport Minister Chris Bonett shows that 102 contraventions were given out on Triq Girolamo Cassar in January, February, and March, 2024.

2022,PN slams lack of detail in traffic-relief plans,"Updated 8.30pm with PL response The Nationalist Party has criticised the government for failing to divulge the exact goals of its proposed measures to tackle Malta’s traffic woes.  Last week, Transport Minister Chris Bonnet unveiled a series of incentives designed to reduce the number of cars on the country’s roads.   These include an offer of €25,000 to drivers willing to give up their car and licence for five years, a proposal to pay 17-year-olds €1,500 a year for four years to ride scooters instead of driving cars, as well as shifting road services such as rubbish collection to off-peak hours.   At a press conference in Msida on Thursday afternoon, shadow minister for transport Mark Anthony Sammut said the least he expected from the government was for it to share its targets.  “For example, how many cars it wants to be removed from the roads, how many youths will put off getting a licence, or how many people will swap their cars for bikes,” Sammut said.  Experts who spoke to Times of Malta said the cash incentive of €25,000 would only result in a maximum of 2,500 fewer drivers – or less than one per cent of all drivers in the country - on the road this year.   Sammut said the government was approaching the problem from the wrong direction.  “Before trying to get people to give up their cars, the government has to ensure there are alternative means of transport. We still don’t have a plan for a mass-transit system. Before the election the government spent €2 million promoting a metro, and now says it isn’t a priority,” he said.  Turning to two-wheeled transport methods such as cycling, Sammut said that the necessary infrastructure had to be in place before commuters were encouraged to make the switch.  “Instead, the transport minister says, ‘We’ll see depending on how many people take up the incentives’,” he said, adding that people’s biggest worry was the lack of safety on the roads.  Sammut insisted that the Opposition agreed with several of the government’s proposals because it had proposed them itself years ago, namely rubbish collection outside of peak hours, the plan to add a cargo-only shipping route between Malta and Gozo, as well as national strategies on walking and cycling.  “On the other hand, we disagree with increasing Transport Malta’s budget by an exorbitant amount. People are not being hired and promoted because they are competent and experienced, but because they are die-hard Labour supporters or people suggested by the minister or Castille,” he said.   Sammut said that if the government wanted to tackle traffic, it needed to shift the country’s economic model away from the importation of foreign labour.  Fellow PN MP David Agius said he was late to the start of the press conference because he himself got stuck in traffic following a collision in Marsa.  He called on the government to reverse its plan to increase the number of years after which a car is deemed to be classic from 30 to 35 years.  “Not only will this increase the number of cars on the roads, since vintage cars can only be driven a maximum of 3,000 kilometres a year, but also because we believe this hobby should be supported,” he said.  Consultation - PL In a statement issued Thursday evening, the Labour Party pointed out before the measures were launched consultation was held about the proposals with experts, social partners and the public.  The PL accused the PN of not wantintg transport to be addressed in Malta, adding that the opposition's mass transport option could take ""decades"" to implement. ""The current needs are of no interest for them,"" the Labour Party said.",03/04/2025,2025-07-03 15:04:59.468533+00,03/04/2025 0:00,FALSE,,,,,,,
2040,Bonett reverses decision to raise age requirement for vintage cars,"Updated 9.30pm Chris Bonett has reversed his decision to raise the age requirement for cars to be considered 'vintage'. Speaking in a Times Talk episode that will be released next week, the Transport Minister said that after consulting with classic car enthusiasts he realised he ""may have jumped the gun"" when he announced the measure. ""I admit we were a bit hasty with that measure. I don't mind admitting that, and I don't think it's a sign of weakness to admit a mistake. Rather, it shows you're serious,"" he said. ""I still agree with the measure but I may have jumped the gun when I announced it. We want to protect the hobby of vintage cars while making sure nobody abuses the system."" Currently, cars that are older than 30 years are exempted from annual licence fees and must only pay an annual €8 administrative fee, provided the vehicle does not exceed 3,000 kilometres per year. Vintage vehicles are marked on Maltese roads with a black number plate. But the authorities observed that some drivers were passing off their old cars as 'vintage', managing to pay very low licence fees for a car they use every day and which is not a classic car at all. Moreover, 'hundreds' of old, second-hand vehicles are being imported every year and registered as vintage cars but used as ordinary cars for every day transportation by abusing the loophole in the system. Last week, as part of a raft of measures aimed at tackling Malta's chronic traffic congestion, Bonett announced the government would curb vintage car abuse by introducing a measure that stipulates that vehicles must be 35 years old to qualify for a black number plate and that they will be subject to inspections. But during the filming of Times Talk on Thursday, Bonett told Times of Malta he will amend that measure and that he takes full responsibility for the oversight. ""We're not after people's hobbies,"" he said. ""We only need to make sure that the fees for classic car enthusiasts are not abused by people who want to keep their junk cars on the road."" Later on Thursday the Minister said on Facebook that there was an agreement on the decision following a meeting with the Maltese Vintage Vehicle Federation.  ""The purpose of the meeting was to understand where we want to go as a Government, to remove from our roads ordinary cars that are being used under the guise of being 'vintage' and abusing the system, while protecting those who invest in truly classic cars,"" he wrote. ""We agreed on everything, and in the coming weeks, after the necessary legal work is done, we will announce how the reform, which everyone agrees we need, will work. ""What I can anticipate from now is that we are satisfied that we can achieve our goal without raising the car age requirement from 30 to 35 years. In fact, we will introduce measures that will strengthen this hobby."" Unplanned measures - PN One hour after the Nationalist Party held a press conference in Msida on Thursday criticising the government's proposals, transport minister Chris Bonett admitted he had changed his mind about the vintage car scheme, the Opposition said. In a statement, the PN said this ""further confirmed just how Saturday's anouncement was unplanned and without consultation."" ""Bonett reversed this measure following the pressure made by the Opposition in the last days in parliament and outside,"" the PN said.",03/04/2025,2025-07-03 15:05:04.648591+00,03/04/2025 0:00,FALSE,,,,,,,

What if people take up the €25,000 offer, give up their car and then take a cab everywhere? Wouldn't that mean no cars were effectively taken off the roads?  And what if most people who take up that offer are elderly who were about to stop driving soon anyway, or people who seldom use their car, or drive only in their neighbourhood or village? These people are not causing the traffic problem, so they will hardly solve congestions by giving up their licence and taking the hefty grant. And is he comfortable asking young people to switch to motorcycles instead of cars? Would he want his own children riding motorbikes on roads often that are often dangerous? In the podcast, which will be released on Wednesday, Bonett acknowledged he will likely not solve the traffic problems but vowed to bring about a culture shift in the way people travel. He said that while immediate solutions are hard to come by, these are only short-term measures to tackle Malta's traffic woes, and a broader, mass transportation system is needed in the long term.

1509,Marsaxlokk councillor pushes for partly pedestrianised seafront,"An independent member of Marsaxlokk’s local council is pushing for a plan to fast-track the pedestrianisation of the town’s seafront road. The plan, initially proposed in the Labour council’s manifesto in 2024, would see the entire length of Xatt is-Sajjieda closed to traffic at the weekends. But this plan hinges on a long-planned construction of a new road connecting Triq Lepanto with Triq il-Kavallerizza in the south of the town, which would allow for traffic to be easily diverted away from the seafront. Construction of the road may now proceed, after the Planning Authority gave the go-ahead for the relocation of an old barumbara – a structure intended to house pigeons or doves – overlooking the proposed road. However, independent councillor Matthew Bugeja told Times of Malta that the council should not wait for the removal of the barumbara and the construction of the road, which could take years. Moreover, several environmental and conservation NGOs have come out against the relocation of the building, arguing that the project will damage its historical integrity and set a dangerous precedent for conservation. In the meantime, Bugeja has proposed an alternative plan for this summer that would serve as a pilot project to show the government that the idea is viable. This would involve only the partial pedestrianisation of Xatt Is-Sajjieda in the evenings, a 200-metre area stretching from the intersection with Triq Duncan to that with Triq San Franġisk. Traffic would be diverted away from the road via Triq Barthelemy and Triq San Franġisk, before rejoining Xatt is-Sajjieda. Cars would be able to park in the car park behind the football pitch.  in Gozo with all the tables and chairs.

1352,"Motorcyclist injured in pothole incident awarded €74,000","A 39-year-old Turkish national has been awarded over €74,000 in damages following an accident in Siġġiewi which left him suffering from a permanent disability. The man was driving his Piaggio Vespa along Triq Għar Lapsi on May 2, 2020, when he stumbled into a pothole, lost his balance and fell off the motorcycle. He was taken to Mater Dei Hospital where he was certified with grievous injuries. Following the incident, the man returned to Turkey since he needed treatment, and the coronavirus pandemic had hit. He also underwent several surgical interventions. As a result of the incident, he sustained permanent disability, which harmed his quality of life. The man eventually returned to Malta. Through his lawyers, he filed an application before the First Hall of the Civil Court, suing the Siġġiewi Local Council and Infrastructure Malta. He requested the court to hold both responsible for the incident and order them to pay him damages. Both Infrastructure Malta and the Siġġiewi local council argued that they were not suited, with the road agency arguing that the council was responsible for maintaining the road, while the local council argued that it was in the hands of the agency. In court, the man testified that as he was driving along Triq Għar Lapsi, direction towards Dingli cliffs, a few meters after he turned the corner, the condition of the road changed dramatically. Who is responsible for the road? He described how the road level went down by a few metres before he drove into a pothole. Moreover, there were no signs that the road surface would deteriorate, and the man said he had no reason to believe that the road surface would change in such a manner. John Fenech from Elles Urban Services Ltd – a company engaged by the council to maintain the roads – acknowledged that the road was in a state of disrepair and it had to be resurfaced. He also testified that the damage to the road was primarily attributable to the frequent passage of heavy vehicles in the service of nearby quarries. He added that the road was not built to take the weight of the vehicles. A police constable similarly testified that the road was in a bad state, noting that there were several cracks in the asphalt and potholes. In establishing who was responsible for the road, the court heard architect David Vassallo from Infrastructure Malta. The witness said the road fell under the responsibility of the local council, however, the road agency intervened and issued an emergency allocation to contractor Philip Agius and Sons for €1.5 million, excluding VAT, in December 2020. The council’s executive secretary, Ritianne Giorgino, told the court that while it was within the council’s boundary, the local council is responsible for maintenance or patching works, while resurfacing falls under the responsibility of the local government. Referring to the mayor’s affidavit, the court observed that while it was outlined that the council has several structures to monitor and ascertain that roads are kept in a good state of repair, this was not the case and notwithstanding the “layers of surveillance adopted by the Council, somewhere down the line, somebody is not doing his job properly or else the technical operandi is not functioning."" The court reminded how the road is used by heavy vehicles and therefore, the road should have been monitored more closely and frequently. It also observed that it was only after the plaintiff was injured that the road was properly repaired. The court concluded that the council was wholly to blame for the accident.  When it came to calculating damages, it took into consideration that 21 months after the accident, the man’s radial nerve did not make a full recovery, and this was most likely improbable. It also took into consideration the court-appointed expert’s observations on the fracture of the distal tibia, which involved an articular surface of the ankle joint and will inevitably lead to arthritic change. The motorcyclist also ended up with substantial amounts of metal implants attached to the humerus and tibia. These foreign bodies provide a slightly increased risk of bone infection during bacetermia, according to the expert. After calculating the damages, the court declared the Siġġiewi local council responsible for the incident and ordered it to pay the man €74,873. Mr Justice Toni Abela presided over the court. Lawyers Kris Busietta and Alessandro Farrugia assisted the plaintiff.",09/05/2025,2025-07-03 15:02:00.214854+00,02/05/2020 8:00,TRUE,Triq Għar Lapsi,Siġġiewi,1,Serious,Motorbike,39,M

1274,Stuck truck under Bay Street Bridge causes traffic chaos,"Updated 11.50am A truck which got stuck under the Bay Street bridge on Tuesday caused heavy traffic and could potentially cause damage to the structure, a Transport Malta official confirmed.  On Tuesday morning, commuters in St Julian’s experienced unusually heavy traffic. This was due to ongoing cabling works by Enemalta and a truck that accidentally got lodged beneath the Bay Street bridge in Paceville. Transport Malta shared a photo of the stuck truck on social media, along with the caption: “Triq Santu Wistin, in the direction of St George’s Bay in St Julian’s, is currently temporarily closed due to a truck blocking the passage. Transport Malta is monitoring the situation and will provide updates as soon as the road is reopened to traffic.”  The situation caused significant congestion throughout the area. The traffic chaos was subsiding by 11.15am. Traffic in the area is being exacerbated by Enemalta's cabling works across various parts of St Julian’s. An Enemalta spokesperson confirmed that Triq Elija Zammit and Triq Is-Swieqi,  part of Triq Santu Wistin and part of Triq Gort are closed. These closures are necessary for the expansion of the electrical distribution system.

1245,PN wins complaint over PBS coverage of government’s traffic measures,"The Broadcasting Authority has upheld a PN complaint over a TVM News bulletin that did not fairly report the Opposition’s reaction to the traffic measures unveiled by Transport Minister Chris Bonett. In its complaint, PN argued that while the government’s measures were presented in two segments on the March 29 evening news bulletin, receiving a total of eight minutes of coverage, the Opposition's reaction was not given similar prominence. The bulletin failed to immediately follow up on this segment with the Opposition’s reaction to the measures, only airing it several minutes later in a shorter feature, after other segments had been shown. By that time, many viewers would have tuned out, PN argued in its complaint, meaning that the Opposition’s reaction unfairly received less visibility. The BA board agreed, turning down PBS’s defence that the Opposition’s position had been given extensive coverage on other days and that the station was not obliged to feature the Opposition’s position immediately after that of the government. The board said the national station’s standard practice is to air the Opposition’s reaction directly after the government’s position. Failing to do so “isolates and weakens the reaction, impacting the element of balance,” the board concluded. As a remedy, the board instructed PBS to open a news bulletin over the coming days with a statement explaining that it had “an obligation to broadcast the Opposition’s stance immediately after the government’s announcement, rather than in a separate and later part of the same news bulletin”. In a short statement reacting to the decision, PN accused Prime Minister Robert Abela of “using what should be the national broadcaster to try to censor those who disagree with him”. “PN will continue taking steps for PBS to no longer remain Super One 2 but to become a truly national broadcaster,” the party said.",14/05/2025,2025-07-03 15:01:29.591294+00,14/05/2025 0:00,FALSE,,,,,,,

In a joint statement, the two associations called on authorities to take immediate action to address the growing problem, which they said is causing significant health and safety concerns. “As we approach the peak of the summer season, the situation at the airport is critical. It is affecting not only vehicle movement but also the experience and safety of passengers,” the statement read. The associations blamed the traffic chaos on “a lack of proper planning and decisions that should never have been taken,” adding that previous discussions with authorities and stakeholders have failed to deliver results. “This is not simply an issue of inconvenience—it raises serious health and safety risks,” they stressed, urging authorities to prioritise a solution before the busy travel season escalates the problem further.",22/05/2025,2025-07-03 15:00:39.848106+00,22/05/2025 0:00,FALSE,,,,,,,

894,"Share first, think later: When 'citizen journalism' crosses ethical lines","Photographing and sharing images of tragic accidents on social media is “citizen journalism at its worst” and highlights the urgent need to focus on digital education across the nation, according to experts in communication and human behaviour. The issue came to light once again following a recent fatal traffic accident in which a motorcyclist died on the spot. After the accident, graphic photos were shared extensively via WhatsApp. This had also happened some months ago when footage of another fatal accident, that involved a car losing control, made the rounds on social media. Prof. Anton Grech, clinical chairman of Mental Health Services, explained that while human curiosity in the case of unusual or dramatic situations is normal – a phenomenon known as rubbernecking – social media amplified this. These actions – of taking and sharing images of tragic situations – were a reflection of a larger situation, he said. Before social media existed there were ‘celebrities’ and ‘spectators’. Social media brought with it a shift in which many people wanted to be protagonists. This was happening in a virtual environment that is saturated with content and, in which, in order to be seen and stand out, the content has to be attention-grabbing. “In parallel with this, we are losing respect for the society around us. We saw this in a recent case when a man was threatening to jump off the Valletta bastions,” he said, referring to the 2021 case when onlookers urged a man to jump from the edge of a Valletta bastion, with many filming the ordeal. “Many people seize all opportunities to gain this recognition without respect for others,” he said, adding that there was an urgent need to educate people on this matter. Prof. Brenda Murphy, a media and gender expert and founder of NGO Mediating Women, agreed that there was the urgent need for more media education – in schools and beyond – through curriculum and public campaigns. “This is a public education issue – we need to re-establish digital boundaries. We need to remind people that our duty of care doesn’t disappear when we are online,” she said. Such cases, she said, were “citizen journalism at its worst” as they offered “a great snapshot of the widening gaps in ‘news production’”. “Journalists and editors are trained, educated, bound by professional regulation – citizens operate without any of these guardrails. While citizen journalism was lauded as a great liberator for information – this is an example of a great backfire,” she said. A deeply problematic phenomenon Murphy explained that the sharing of such images was a “deeply problematic phenomenon” that reflects multiple pressures converging at the moment. From a digital culture perspective, she said, we are living in a world where everything is documented, and the boundary between private and public is becoming increasingly eroded. “In the case of tragic moments, there seems to be an underlying belief that if something shocking happens, it should be recorded and shared. The algorithms that drive social media amplify this. They reward visibility, and sadly that includes tragic events,” she said. Then there was the conversation on media ethics.  “We may have the capacity to capture something digitally, but that doesn’t mean we should. Sharing media content has become so normalised it completely breaches the private-public boundary. We need to be mindful that sharing a traumatic event compounds trauma – not just for the family and friends but the wider community is impacted too. We cannot justify this ‘norm drift’ by saying ‘it’s already out there, so it’s ok to repost’,” she said.",29/05/2025,2025-07-03 14:59:54.173761+00,27/05/2025 12:30,TRUE,Xemxija bypass,Xemxija,1,Fatal,Motorbike,35,M

695,Could road quality be leading to accidents? New policing unit plans to find out,"A newly formed Road Policing Unit will be able to determine how and whether the quality of the roads are contributing to traffic accidents.  During a media briefing on Friday, the unit demonstrated how it works. A police car is equipped with a special device linked to a gyroscope on the roof. As the car drives over the road, the device measures the quality of the road surface. During the demonstration, a car sped down the road towards a mock traffic accident and made a sudden stop. The device within the car printed out a piece of paper that included data that helps police understand if poor road conditions may have played a role in a crash. They also need to take other factors into account, such as whether the road is wet or sloped.  They placed numbered yellow cones, which help to identify the evidence as investigations are carried out later on. Depending on the gravity of the situation, the police might even deploy a drone to get a shot of the accident and the surrounding area. The pictures the drone takes can then be used to develop a 3D image of the site, which is then reviewed in their offices. The data collected from this investigation is then passed on to the magistrate who is dealing with the case. The police initially announced that they would be setting up this new unit earlier this year after the death of motorcyclist Dieter Vink, who crashed into a skip in December 2024.",06/06/2025,2025-07-03 14:59:02.816278+00,06/06/2025 0:00,FALSE,,,,,,,

645,Restaurant canopies along The Strand pose ‘catastrophic risk’,"The outdoor restaurant structures located all along The Strand pose a “catastrophic risk” to pedestrians and residents, especially if a fire had to break out, a report by a risk management company found. The report highlights a grim reality: fire engines and ambulances have no clear access, and pedestrians are being forced into oncoming traffic. Thousands of people use the stretch of road daily. “The fact that this situation has been allowed to develop into its current state shows a total lack of consideration given to safety of anyone,” a report by Shield Consultants said. Sliema resident Anna Maria Baldacchino, a member of the Sliema Residents Group, lives on The Strand – located on Triq ix-Xatt along Sliema and Gżira – and decided to commission the study herself. The street is lined with restaurants and bars that have built outdoor catering areas protruding into the road, leaving a gap between the building and the outdoor area to allow for a public pavement. Speaking to Times of Malta, Baldacchino said this began last year when an apartment adjacent to hers caught fire, but the fire engines were unable to open their ladders, so the firefighters were forced to gain access through the building. “I was worried because obviously incidents happen and I always thought, if something had to happen what will be the outcome,” Baldacchino said. She resorted to the authorities, however, she never received a straight answer about any form of risk management study. “Nothing happened. At the end of the day, my life and the lives of other residents are at stake here,” she said. ‘High risk of a traffic collision’ The report goes into detail about how the extension of the outdoor areas creates a hazard for cars driving on the inner lane which tend to steer their cars towards the outer lane increasing the “probability of a collision”. The situation also becomes more dangerous if there is a delivery vehicle, which is forced to stop in the middle of the road, as there are no loading bays available. Signed by fire risk management consultant Andre Muscat, the report further noted how the outdoor structures block the view of anyone who wishes to cross at the pedestrian crossing. “Pedestrians need to walk onto the road in order to be seen by approaching vehicles,” the report said.  Given all the obstacles, the report raised serious concerns about the increased risk people face in the event of a fire or other emergency. “There is also the risk of a fire starting in, or spreading to, the outside extension,” the report added. The report noted that these catering establishments are surrounded by residential buildings with only one stairway for access. If residents were forced to evacuate, this would cause “great congestion and confusion”. The report also questioned whether a fire engine would have enough space to utilise hydraulic platforms or turntable ladders, given the protruding canopy. The number of obstructions might also further delay emergency responders from reaching the residents. It added that ambulances might find difficulty parking near the building and further difficulty to get a stretcher through the “crowded and congested environment”. Pavement is hazardous for people with mobility difficulties The obstructed and congested pavement also endangers the elderly and individuals with mobility impairments, the report flagged. It also mentioned the difficulties of walking on the pavement with young children and describing passing through with a pushchair as being “almost impossible”. In the report’s conclusion it said: “The conditions reviewed and reported in the report constitute several instances of a clear and present hazard laden with catastrophic risk potential from the road users to the pedestrians to the residents and even to the customers of the establishments themselves. “Unless brought under control quickly, the situation is only bound to get worse,” the report concluded. This is not the first time Baldacchino has challenged these outdoor structures. In January 2024, she said she applied for permission to take up public land where the restaurant Gourmet Cocktail Bar & Grill had an outdoor seating structure that had been operating illegally for around a decade. Later that month, the Planning Authority approved a permit to sanction the restaurant canopy. Earlier this year, Baldacchino gave a passionate speech in the European Parliament about noise pollution caused by bars and restaurants.",08/06/2025,2025-07-03 14:58:49.139238+00,08/06/2025 0:00,FALSE,,,,,,,

317,Court of Appeal triples damages awarded to the widow of Freeport worker,"A Court of Appeal has tripled the sum in damages to be awarded to the widow of a port worker who was injured in a work site accident over 15 years ago.  On Monday, Pawla Fenech, the widow of Carmel Fenech, was awarded over €106,000 in damages by the Court of Appeal. The worker suffered severe leg injuries in an accident on August 4 2009 as he worked on the unloading of containers off a ship. He was 52 years old at the time and was wearing safety equipment provided by the Malta Dockers' Union. The man requested payment of damages and eventually sued Malta Freeport Terminals Ltd and shipowners CMA.  He passed away on January 2, 2013. On May 16, 2019, the First Hall of the Civil Court held Malta Freeport Terminals Limited responsible for the injuries and the disability the worker had suffered due to those injuries. It ordered the company to pay the plaintiff €34,648.50 in damages. Back then, his wife, who entered into the suit after he died, appealed the judgment, arguing that the amount was incorrect. She argued that tax and social security contributions should not have been deducted from the damages awarded and questioned whether there was a mistake in the calculation made by the first court. The Court of Appeal held that the court of first instance was wrong when it deducted income tax and the social security contributions from the compensation, as this benefited the respondents and not the plaintiff. As for the calculation of compensation, the Court of Appeal held that it should have been based on the period when Fenech could not work, between August 5, 2009 and April 24, 2011, as well as the period when he returned to work until his death, since Fenech suffered a disability from which he did not recover. The Court of Appeal therefore revoked the €34,648.50 in damages awarded by the first court, and instead awarded the widow €106,816. Chief Justice Mark Chetcuti presided, alongside Mr Justice Giannino Caruana Demajo and Anthony Ellul.",24/06/2025,2025-07-03 14:57:22.893193+00,23/06/2025 0:00,FALSE,,,,,,,

46,Collision unit and traffic bureau to work together,"The Traffic Investigation Bureau, a body that will investigate collisions and recommend changes, is in the “final stages” of being set up, the transport minister has said. “This week I was given the first draft of the legislation, so pretty soon I will be presenting it to cabinet,” Chris Bonett told Times of Malta late last week. Bonett’s statement comes weeks after the police set up their own body to investigate road collisions. At the end of May, the government announced the Roads Policing Unit, a specialised police department to enforce traffic rules and investigate the causes of major traffic accidents. Police officers received specialised training, while new equipment has been procured to facilitate the gathering and analysis of evidence, ranging from driving methods to road conditions. On Friday, Transport Minister Bonett said the two bodies will work hand in hand. “There are two types of investigation that are carried out. First of all, to see what led to an accident, and second, to see what happens next... the idea is to work together,” he said. Bonett later clarified that the bureau’s main task will be to analyse how to make roads safer and recommend changes. He said discussions on where one body’s remit begins and ends are ongoing. “The idea is that the (police) unit and the bureau help each other to better service the public.” A bureau to investigate traffic collisions and recommend changes was first announced by Bonett’s predecessor, Aaron Farrugia, in December 2022, on the back of Malta’s deadliest year on the road. In 2025, 11 people have so far died in traffic incidents: four pedestrians, three car drivers, three motorcyclists and one cyclist. The bureau was meant to be up and running by the end of 2023 but ran into delays because of the judiciary’s hesitancy to share the contents of magisterial inquiries. In February, Bonett told Times of Malta that a provision in the magisterial inquiry reform will give the Traffic Investigation Bureau the ability to gather information from inquiries.",30/06/2025,2025-07-02 10:10:09.622652+00,27/06/2025 0:00,FALSE,,,,,,,
79,"Offer of €25,000 to quit driving is behind schedule, minister admits","The government’s plan to pay drivers €25,000 if they give up their driving licence for five years has yet to be finalised, according to Transport Minister Chris Bonett.  The incentive, one of 45 measures aimed at reducing Malta’s car dependency that were unveiled in March, was meant to be introduced by June.   Speaking at a news conference on Monday morning to provide an update on which measures had been implemented in the second quarter of the year, Bonett said the cash offer - a €25,000 grant split into five yearly payments - would start as a pilot project rather than being open to everyone straight away.   However, the government has yet to finalise which demographic it will be targeting first.   “It’s not a budget issue. We don’t want it to simply be an exercise in handing out money. We want to target people who will contribute to reducing traffic,” the minister said.  Bonett suggested that young people could be the first to be eligible for the offer.   “The number of young people who want to get their driving licence as soon as they turn 18 is still alarmingly high,"" he said.   The minister said that several objectives had been completed, including shifting services such as road cleansing and landscaping away from peak hours, and an increase in public transport routes.   Training has also started on TM Roads, the government’s new online platform that will be used to improve efficiency, collaboration and transparency on road works.  Bonett said some other plans were running slightly behind schedule, but would be completed in the next week or two. He cited a park-and-ride facility for Paola and new circular bus routes in Paola and Siġġiewi, and the launch of a national cycling strategy as examples.  Bonett said that by September, customer-facing government departments would start offering services after 9am. The shift to a later starting time is intended to reduce rush hour traffic on local roads.  A study on the feasibility of a cargo ferry between the Freeport and Gozo will be completed by September, as will a green travel policy that will encourage government workers to commute to work without using their cars.   Asked for a timeline on the start of a ferry service connecting Sliema, Buġibba and Gozo, Bonett said more details would be provided at the launch of the ferry terminal in Buġibba on Wednesday.   Bonett stressed that the measures were not meant to achieve “sensationalist” goals such as a huge reduction in traffic overnight, but to change the public’s attitude towards cars.   “A culture change is not something that happens overnight – it takes time. I want the next generation to be less car-dependent,” he said.",30/06/2025,2025-07-02 10:10:14.665739+00,30/06/2025 0:00,FALSE,,,,,,,

53,Widely-respected diver Dione Galdes dies after Sunday accident,"A 59-year-old diver has succumbed to injuries he suffered in an accident in Cirkewwa early on Sunday. The police confirmed his death on Tuesday morning at Mater Dei Hospital. Dione Galdes an experienced diving instructor from Iklin, was widely respected in the diving community.  ""Dione was not only a skilled diving instructor but also a trusted mentor, a generous advisor, and a true companion to all who had the privilege of knowing him,"" said Andrew P Zammit chairman, Calypso Subaqua Club in a Facebook tribute. ""His calm, approachable nature made him easy to work with, and his passion for diving was matched only by his dedication to sharing it with others."" He said that over the years Dione gave tirelessly of his time and expertise—supporting the club with teaching, technical guidance, and unwavering friendship. ""Many of us took our first underwater breaths under his care, and countless divers carry a part of his legacy in their training and love for the sport. His absence leaves a deep void in our community, but his spirit, his laughter, and his wisdom will remain with us always."" Magistrate Ian Farrugia is leading an investigation.",01/07/2025,2025-07-02 10:10:10.935182+00,01/07/2025 0:00,FALSE,,,,,,,
42,Calls for first-aid centre at Ċirkewwa Marine Park grow following diver's death,"The diving community wants two ""wasted"" rooms at the Ċirkewwa Marine Park to be used as a first-aid centre, after a renowned local diver was given emergency treatment out in the sun in front of other divers on Sunday. On Tuesday, 59-year-old Dione Galdes died after succumbing to injuries he suffered in an accident in Ċirkewwa on Sunday. He was an experienced dive instructor from Iklin who was widely respected in the diving community. Diver David Agius said Galdes was given first-aid attention on the pavement in the sun, in front of other divers. Agius, who runs the diving community website divinginfo.mt, said that it was an unfortunate accident that happened in around two metres of water prior to the actual dive starting. The diving community has repeatedly said that the Ċirkewwa Marine Park does not have a proper first-aid centre, and it has previously appealed for two rooms to be used as a first-aid centre. When news that Galdes suffered serious injuries spread on Sunday, Agius sent an email to the prime minister and the concerned authorities flagging the poor conditions in which Galdes received first-aid care. “All treatment in full view of arriving local divers, diving tourists and passersby for close to 30 minutes, being given CPR in almost 40 degrees of sun until an ambulance from Mater Dei arrived,” the email read. As this happened in public, Agius added that this scene also poorly affected divers mentally. The email reminded the government of the possibility of having two rooms, located next to the divers’ bathrooms at Ċirkewwa Marine Park, serve as a first aid room and a site office for park managers. Currently, these rooms are owned by Transport Malta and leased out to Gozo Channel Operations Ltd.  In April, the website uploaded an article highlighting the shortcomings of first-aid availability on-site. The article explained that first aiders and park managers stay in a rented container in the summer. However, they are unable to rent this in winter due to storms that may hit the area. First aid equipment - AED and spinal board - are located outside the divers' bathrooms, exposed to the sun and rain, it said. Besides this, the park lacks places where proper treatment can be administered, it added. “A better equipped first aid room might provide access to better and more advanced first aid equipment and conditions that may allow better recovery opportunities and/or at least, privacy,” the article wrote. The article referred to a similar incident in October 2024, where a British diver who died after succumbing to injuries was also given CPR for almost 30 minutes outside. The website, in May, announced that it had collected 236 signatures from the diving community, calling for the rooms to be used as a health centre and office. Questions were sent to Transport Malta and the Gozo Ministry.",01/07/2025,2025-07-02 10:10:09.024681+00,01/07/2025 0:00,FALSE,,,,,,,
86,"PN: Proper planning, not piecemeal announcements, needed to solve traffic issues","Malta needs a long-term strategy to address traffic and transport issues, rather than the current unplanned and piecemeal announcements being thrown out by the government, Mark Anthony Sammut, shadow minister for transport, said on Wednesday. He was speaking during a press conference held at the busy Aldo Moro Road in Marsa, alongside the shadow minister for the infrastructure Joseph Giglio. They noted that over recent months, Transport Minister Chris Bonett announced a series of measures aimed at tackling the traffic crisis. Some of these were meant to be implemented by the end of June but, as the minister himself confirmed, they ""got stuck in traffic."" Among these initiatives were a park-and-ride project in several localities, and a proposal to offer €25,000 to individuals who surrender their driving licence for five years. However, the minister had earlier this week revealed that the latter initiative had not yet progressed and the government had yet to finalise which demographic it would target first.   Sammut said the initiative had been announced before proper studies and costings were made. “No deadlines have been met. This was launched without proper studies or costing,” Sammut said. He recalled that less than a month ago, the minister also went into reverse gear over plans to raise the threshold for vintage car classification by five years to 35. Similarly, a proposed ferry service to Buġibba, promised for summer, had still not materialised, with June now over. “This government is not following a clear plan, it is managing by crisis,” he said, also pointing to massive inconvenience caused by simultaneous, uncoordinated roadworks in areas such as Ċirkewwa, St Paul’s Bay, Golden Bay and St Julian’s. He argued that this reflected a basic lack of traffic management. Giglio echoed the sentiment, accusing the government of selling propaganda rather than delivering real results. “Despite all the announcements, the impact on the roads has not matched the minister’s claims,” he said. “All we need to do is look around us every day. There is confusion, a sense of crisis management. Even the announcement of a new Transport Malta unit to investigate traffic accidents - when this function already exists within the police – shows lack of planning,” he said.",02/07/2025,2025-07-02 10:10:15.604006+00,02/07/2025 0:00,FALSE,,,,,,,

178241,Malta’s approach to tackling traffic congestion questioned in new EU report,"An EU report has questioned Malta’s carrot-not-stick approach to tackling traffic congestion, arguing that incentive-based measures have been “largely ineffective”. The European Semester Report, which traces Malta’s progress across a range of sectors, was presented to MCESD on Wednesday. The report points to a raft of measures unveiled earlier this year, singling out proposals to offer cash incentives to people willing to give up their cars or driving licences, or those willing to switch to small motorcycles. These measures “still favour rewards over sanctions,” the report says. Meanwhile, promises to create new parking facilities “will further encourage car use, leading to increased congestion”. The report notes that “measures to tackle congestion by disincentivising the use of private cars…are not foreseen”. “Policies in place to address traffic congestion have been predominately incentive-based and largely ineffective,” the report says. Its authors also say that measures to improve public road transport and alternative modes of mobility “seem to be systematically lacking,” with a 2024 ban on rental e-scooters further reducing options for alternative mobility. Government figures say the proposals unveiled earlier in the year are short-term, voluntary initiatives intended to encourage a cultural shift towards alternative modes of transport, with longer-term measures (including a mass transit system) set to follow. Meanwhile, recently announced plans to extend Malta’s sea transport network have broadly met with public approval. The report explores several other areas of Malta’s social and economic development, heaping praise on the country’s economic performance but flagging several broader concerns. Economic growth is expected to continue, with Malta’s low unemployment figures likely to remain stable. Meanwhile, the country’s deficit is likely to dip at a faster rate than expected, with the country’s debt-to-GDP ratio well within the EU’s recommended margins. However, Malta remains highly dependent on fossil fuels, with one of the lowest rates of renewable energy uptake across the EU. Malta’s blanket energy subsidies “hinder electrification” and should be phased out in favour of further investment in green investments and strengthening grid capacity, the report says. Meanwhile, poverty is rising among specific groups, including children, non-EU nationals, and older adults. Policy measures to address poverty among vulnerable groups have yet to yield results, the report suggests. And Malta still faces long-standing problems of court delays and skills shortages, with “systemic shortcomings” in Malta’s educational system resulting in “persistently insufficient basic skills,” as well as low enrolment of tertiary students in STEM subjects. Positive report but several 'areas for improvement': MCESD In a statement, MCESD said the report highlights “a strong and dynamic Maltese economy but points to areas requiring improvement”. The Council outlined the call for Malta to invest more in research and development, as well as to cut transport emissions and tackle traffic congestion. Meanwhile, Finance Minister Clyde Caruana welcomed the report, describing it as “a moment of satisfaction but also of motivation”. “We must continue working together to invest in crucial areas such as research, innovation, and training, and create a sustainable and inclusive economy for all,” he said.",09/07/2025,2025-07-18 14:43:09.06644+00,09/07/2025 0:00,FALSE,,,,,,,

297729,Rider injured in hit-and-run is told tunnel cameras don’t work,"A scooter rider injured in a hit-and-run crash in the Regional Road tunnels earlier this month is struggling to track down the driver, after being told that none of the tunnel cameras work. Giuseppe Di Dio, a 22-year-old Sicilian who works as a DJ and event organiser, was riding his Vespa 300 on July 2 at around 12.30pm when he was hit. As he entered the tunnel heading towards Swieqi, he says a van crossed into his lane, cut him off and crashed into him, knocking him off his Vespa. “I feel super lucky to tell the story. It hurt a lot. When I was on the floor, I could feel my burns,” he told Times of Malta. Shocked by the impact, Di Dio said he could not identify the van but recalled opening his eyes to see the driver standing over him. According to Di Dio, the man looked South Asian and was wearing a blue shirt. He believes he was driving a delivery van but is unsure which company the van belonged to. “He came over, checked I was alive, told me nothing and rushed off,” he said. “I know if I saw him, I would recognise him.” Thankfully, other drivers stopped to help Di Dio. He was taken to Mater Dei Hospital, where he said he had to wait between six to seven hours before being seen. “That was horrible. I couldn’t take it anymore and began to scream out in pain, and only then did they see me,” he said. He was initially told he had minor injuries and was prescribed painkillers. But after several days, his wounds became increasingly painful and doctors at Saint James Hospital later confirmed they were infected. Alongside the physical injuries, Di Dio said his motorbike was damaged and he incurred around €4,000 in expenses for medical treatment, medications, transport and missed work. “I want a refund for the damages but the most important thing is I want to find out who hit me to avoid future accidents,” he said.  After being treated, Di Dio filed a police report. He hoped CCTV footage from the tunnel would help identify the van. But he said police informed him that the security cameras inside the Ta’ Giorni tunnels do not work. “It’s insane. The policeman told me that none of the cameras they have for the tunnels work,” he said. “I told them that it is impossible but they told me again that none of them work.” In 2020, the government launched a €10 million project to upgrade Malta’s major tunnels, including Ta’ Giorni, which included the installation of security cameras. When asked if the cameras were working on the day of the incident, the transport ministry said: “The Traffic Control Centre did not have CCTV coverage in the mentioned area on the 2nd of July 2025.” The ministry did not answer questions about whether the cameras are operational. Police confirmed that a report on the accident had been filed and investigations are ongoing.

353524,Elderly man acquitted of traffic fatality as victim is blamed,"A man has been acquitted of causing the death of a pedestrian in Paola in 2018 after finding that the victim caused the incident through negligence and the motorist could do nothing about it. The accident happened at Triq Wied Bladun on May 13, 2018. George Glanville, now 83, from Fgura was accused of having caused the death of his friend, William Cocker. The court heard that on that day, Glanville was driving his Kia Rio on a clear road. The traffic light was green. Behind him a man rode a motorcycle accompanied by a passenger. Cocker suddenly emerged from behind a wall and attempted to cross the road straight in front of Glanville’s car. Glanville told the police he was driving at 40-50 km/hr and stopped the vehicle immediately the accident happened. He got out of his car and spoke to Cocker who was still responsive. He only left the scene after the police allowed him to. Glanville told the police that he was sorry for what had happened, since Cocker was his friend and he had known him for a long time. He also kept visiting Cocker in hospital every two days until his death on May 31.   The motorcyclist who had been following Glanville testified that Cocker just crossed the road suddenly. Glanville hit the pedestrian and stopped the car immediately. The man recalled assisting the driver and the victim, who were two elderly men and knew each other. Another eyewitness said that the pedestrian was crossing on the pedestrian crossing when the lights were green for vehicles. Superintendent Hubert Cini testified that Cocker’s injuries were certified as grievous; however, he was not seen at risk of dying at the time. A post-mortem investigation determined, however, that Cocker’s death was a result of the incident. In their submissions on punishment, the prosecution said the charges were issued after the post-mortem examination showed that the victim’s death was caused by the incident. It also argued that while the pedestrian crossed when the lights were green for vehicles, the driver failed to keep a proper lookout. The defence countered that the victim crossed the road without proper look-out when he should not have even crossed. The driver had no time to react. The court referred to the eyewitnesses who testified how Cocker just crossed the road without waiting for the red lights for vehicles. From their testimony, it emerged that the accused could not reasonably have avoided the incident. The court said that it was convinced that the accused was driving responsibly. The evidence showed that the victim had been negligent in this case and that it led to the unfortunate incident. “For this reason, one cannot say that the accused did not keep a proper look out since the victim’s action was unpredictable and there was nothing that the accused could have done to avoid the incident,” Magistrate Nadine Sant Lia observed. The court ruled that the incident was caused by Cocker’s imprudence, which created an unpredictable emergency that made it impossible and unreasonable for the accused to take timely action and avoid the incident. Glanville was acquitted of having caused Cocker’s death through negligent driving. Magistrate Nadine Sant Lia presided over the case.

467185,‘Chaos on the roads is growing’: PN,"The Nationalist Party has accused the government of lacking political will to tackle the “growing chaos” on Malta’s roads and seas.   The party was reacting to a spate of traffic accidents in recent days that left several people dead and others seriously injured.  At a press conference on Wednesday, shadow minister for transport Mark Anthony Sammut noted that halfway through the year, there had already been 12 traffic deaths.  “It’s clear that the chaos on our roads is growing. In the face of this, the [transport] minister remains silent,” he said, reiterating PN’s call for a national action plan on road safety.  Sammut offered several explanations for the root cause of traffic accidents, including motorists getting frustrated by delays and congestion, and a lack of education on the rules of the road.   “But the primary cause is a lack of law enforcement. The fact is that you barely ever see traffic officers. We need effective and continuous enforcement, not just during the Christmas period. To make matters worse, penalties are not harsh enough for people who kill and maim pedestrians.”  He added that the number of motorists driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs, especially cannabis and cocaine, was also on the rise.  If the PN were elected to government, Sammut said, it would prioritise the sector with a series of specific measures, such as launching an education campaign on how to share the road, while providing better infrastructure for cyclists and motorcyclists.   Sammut also observed that the transport safety investigative commission, first mooted in 2023, had still not been set up.  ‘Reports of incidents at sea have more than doubled’  Meanwhile, PN spokesman for maritime affairs Ivan Castillo said Malta’s seas were also becoming more unsafe, citing figures that showed maritime incidents had increased from 17 to 41 in the space of just four years.   “Enforcement is not increasing at the same rate. There is a clear problem with resources dedicated to enforcement and safety at sea. It’s impossible for officers to keep up with the increasing number of vessels navigating our seas,” Castillo said.  He recalled that the government had spent 100,000 on RHIBs, the vessels used by TM’s Maritime Division, after five rigid hull inflatable boats that were bought for €721,000 were subsequently found to be unseaworthy.  Darren Carabott, the shadow minister for home affairs, said that every accident meant there were family and friends who were grieving or waiting desperately for good news from hospital.  “We can have the best laws on paper, but they are for nothing if there is no proper enforcement,” he said.  On Saturday, a 27-year-old motorcyclist was killed in a traffic accident in Pembroke. The following day, a 62-year old woman died when she was trapped between two cars in a crash in Floriana. Three fatalities in three separate incidents occurred the following day. A 71-year-old woman lost her life following a crash in Fgura, which also involved Prime Minister Robert Abela’s mother and father.   Later on Sunday, a 58-year-old man lost control of his Honda motorcycle in Pietà before crashing into a pavement. He died soon after. And that evening, a 62-year old woman died when she was trapped between two cars in a crash in Valletta. Her husband is in critical condition. On Tuesday, a 63-year-old Tallinja driving instructor was killed when a bus rolled back on him at the Floriana park and ride facility. The man, Karmenu Muscat, was a former footballer who played for Malta’s national team.  And last week, a 79-year-old woman died in an accident in Lija.  Cycling group lists proposals for road safety In a separate statement on Wednesday, the Rota cycling group also called for immediate action to tackle the situation on the roads, pointing out that Malta is on a devastating trajectory to exceed the 2022 record of 26 road deaths in a year. ""We cannot continue to treat road deaths as isolated incidents or unfortunate inevitabilities. These are systemic failures: failures in enforcement, infrastructure design, and in political will,"" the group said. The group said road design must be such that it prioritised the safety of all users, especially the most vulnerable: pedestrians and cyclists.  Malta also needed law enforcement that matched the scale of the crisis. ""It is absurd that the Malta Police Force is expected to carry out effective enforcement with only 18 breathalysers at its disposal. Road safety is not achieved through slogans—it requires proper resources, strong policy, and sustained enforcement,"" it said. The group suggested the immediate rollout of average speed cameras, not just single-point speedtraps; implementation and enforcement of 30 km/h zones in all urban areas; regular, well-resourced spot checks and sobriety testing; proper maintenance of roads, pavements and cycle lanes and proper law enforcement, including fines that reflected the gravity of endangering human life. Legislative reform The group also called for stricter penalties for motorists responsible for killing or seriously injuring pedestrians or cyclists and the introduction of presumed liability, a principle already in place across most EU member states, which places greater responsibility on drivers in the event of collisions with vulnerable users",30/07/2025,2025-07-30 14:32:14.67946+00,03/08/2025 15:30,FALSE,,,,,,,

In a tribute post to the 63-year-old, the Maltese Olympic Committee said Muscat’s Olympian legacy will not be forgotten. “Karmenu proudly represented Malta in cycling at the 1980 Moscow Olympic Games,” the MOC said, adding they are “deeply saddened” by his passing. Muscat was among only a handful of Maltese athletes in the Games held 45 years ago.  As part of the cycling team, Muscat participated in the team trials where Malta finished in the 20th position out of 23 nations, beating Libya, Cameroon and Ethiopia. The MOC sent their condolences to Muscat’s family and loved ones.

467108,Insurers join calls for random drug and alcohol testing of motorists,"Insurers have backed a leading doctor’s calls for random drug and alcohol testing of motorists. In a statement, the Insurance Association Malta said it “fully supports” Mater Dei emergency department doctor Jonathan Joslin “regarding the urgent need for stronger enforcement and deterrents to address drink and drug driving on our roads.” Joslin called for random testing of motorists in an article published in Monday’s Times of Malta, when he described the lack of legal provisions for such testing as a “critical gap” in enforcement. Referencing data collected by its members in 2022 that found that only around three per cent of serious traffic accidents saw the use of breathalysers, the association said the situation “remains a cause for concern”. It noted it had “long advocated for more robust enforcement in this area”, including participating in the Malta Road Safety Council and proposing legal amendments putting roadside drug testing on the same level of importance as alcohol testing. The association said it “remains committed to supporting road safety measures, as demonstrated in the past with the donation of breathalyser equipment”. “We continue to call on authorities to prioritise investment in the resources and training needed to enable police to carry out consistent, effective roadside testing, particularly in the context of serious traffic accidents.”  It stressed that a “visible and active police presence is not a sign of excessive enforcement but rather a proven deterrent against dangerous driving behaviour”, noting evidence showed that increased monitoring of motorists during the festive season “directly contributes to improved outcomes”. The association urged authorities to “implement both alcohol and drug testing measures more systematically and without delay”. “Road safety is a shared responsibility—and it deserves unwavering commitment.” Joslin said the country should urgently introduce legal provisions allowing police to conduct random breath and saliva testing for alcohol and drugs, with a shift away from the requirement of “reasonable suspicion” essential to deter would-be offenders. The doctor also said the police must have a visible and routine presence on the roads, with random checkpoints, unmarked patrol vehicles, mobile testing units and immediate roadside suspensions of drivers who fail tests.

Speaking on TVM news, Spiteri noted that between Thursday and Monday, the emergency ambulance service attended over 200 cases daily. “Half of the 1,000 calls for assistance included people with serious problems [who did not need immediate medical assistance for survival], and 10% of them were in a critical situation in which, a few minutes could make a difference between life and death”, he said. Spiteri appealed to people who happened to be passing near an accident, to keep away from the site in order not to disrupt the emergency doctors. He called for more sensitivity and for people not to film or photograph accidents, saying this caused psychological damage to patients and their relatives.

489138,Random drug and alcohol testing of motorists ‘long overdue’,"Momentum has joined calls for the introduction of random drug and alcohol testing of motorists. In a statement Friday, the party urged “immediate action” on the issue, saying it “fully supports” a call by Mater Dei emergency department doctor Jonathan Joslin for random testing of road users. Joslin made the appeal after three people died in three separate accidents on Sunday, calling the lack of legal provision for such testing “one of the most critical gaps in current road safety enforcement”. Momentum said the introduction of random testing – not requiring reasonable suspicion – was “not just a necessary step, it is long overdue”. “Too many lives have been shattered, too many families left broken, and too many near-misses ignored. Road safety in Malta cannot wait for another tragedy. We must act with urgency and determination”, the party said. “Momentum stands firmly behind the implementation of random testing, in line with proven international best practices that have saved lives across Europe.” The party stressed that driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs was “not a ‘personal choice’; it is a public threat”. “Random testing is not about punishing people, it is about deterrence, about prevention, and about protecting innocent lives. Allowing reckless behaviour on our roads to go unchecked is something we should all be worried about.” Momentum committee member Matthew Agius said that while the party was encouraged by growing awareness of the issue, “awareness without action is meaningless”. “It is time for Parliament, authorities, and enforcement agencies to rise to the occasion and introduce a robust, transparent and fair system of random roadside testing, one that is backed by law, supported by technology, and enforced consistently.” The party emphasised placing a “culture of responsibility, accountability, and safety” at the centre of transport policy, warning there was “no room for complacency”. It called on the government to fast-track legal changes to combat the issue and advocated for roads to be built to encourage motorists to drive slower. On Wednesday, insurers added their voice to the calls for random testing.",01/08/2025,2025-08-01 06:59:24.788274+00,11/08/2025 15:30,FALSE,,,,,,,
489424,Deadliest week for road fatalities in at least 25 years,"Six people were killed between July 23 and 29, marking the deadliest week on Malta’s roads in at least 25 years, a toll that one expert says is a result of chronic failure to prioritise safety in road design. Data compiled by transport activist Paolo Cassar Manghi shows that no other seven-day period since at least 2000 has recorded so many road deaths. Cassar Manghi, a transport researcher and road safety advocate, described the spike in fatalities as “tragic but not surprising”, warning that the country’s road infrastructure often encourages speed rather than discouraging risk. Among the six victims were a driving instructor crushed by a runaway bus, a motorcyclist and a pedestrian killed in a crash involving a parked car. On the same week, three others were killed in unrelated violent incidents, in one of the bloodiest weeks in Malta on record. On July 23, a 79-year-old woman from Mosta died after the Renault van she was a passenger in crashed with a Suzuki Swift car in Lija. Three days later, Tenyo Kosev died when his Honda motorcycle was involved in a collision with a BMW 1 Series motorcycle in Pembroke at around 1am. Last Sunday, three people died. Mildred Azzopardi was crushed to death after a vehicle ploughed into a parked car, fatally hitting the 62-year-old. Azzopardi’s husband, Alfred, was critically injured. Benjamin Chetcuti, who was driving the car that hit the Azzopardis, is facing charges of manslaughter and driving under the influence of alcohol. The other two victims were a motorcyclist and a car passenger who was involved in a collision with a car driven by former president George Abela with his wife Margaret in the passenger seat.

490267,Man admits to driving without licence and insurance cover,"A man has pleaded guilty to driving a van without insurance and while his licence was suspended. Omar Alhamdoalgorsh, 27, was accused of driving without a licence and insurance cover, breaching bail conditions and recidivism. Alhamdoalgorsh was caught after being stopped by community police and Transport Malta officials carrying out traffic inspections on Triq Burmarrad in St Paul’s Bay, police inspector Warren Galea told a court Tuesday. The officers asked the accused for a licence and he said he did not have one. The sergeant contacted the Police’s control room and was informed that Alhamdoalgorsh’s licence was suspended until September 12. He was also informed that the man signs the bail book at Qawra Police Station. The man was arrested and arraigned in court on Tuesday afternoon. He confirmed he would plead guilty. While hearing submissions on punishment, the police inspector said this was the second time Alhamdoalgorsh was caught driving without a licence and the law was clear. The inspector said that while the man had adhered to his bail conditions, this incident led to a breach since he committed a crime while out on bail. Galea added that the man regretted having driven without a licence. Defence lawyer Noel Bianco said the man miscalculated and thought the suspension had elapsed and that he was clear to get back behind the wheel. He was also on his way to work when caught driving without a licence. The court fined him €5,500 and disqualified him from having a driving licence for 18 months, beginning after the current suspension elapses on September 12. The court ordered the forfeiture of €1,000 from his personal guarantee but did not revoke his bail. “In these circumstances, you should really be careful. With all these incidents around us caused by the lack of care for traffic regulations, you should really be careful,” Magistrate Jean Paul Grech warned the man before he left the courtroom. Police inspector Warren Galea prosecuted. Lawyer Noel Bianco assisted the accused.",12/08/2025,2025-08-12 16:28:52.188882+00,12/08/2025 0:00,FALSE,,,,,,,
490183,Breathalyser showed motorist in fatal Valletta crash was five times over limit,"A breathalyser test on Benjamin Chetcuti, the driver involved in last month's fatal crash in Valletta showed him to be some five times above the legal limit, a court heard on Tuesday. The test returned a reading of 139.2 μg/100ml (microgrammes of alcohol per 100 ml) of breath or about five times the legal limit, Superintendent Nicholas Vella said at the compilation of evidence against Chetcuti, an AFM soldier arraigned last month. He stands accused of the involuntary homicide of Mildred Azzopardi, driving under the influence and grievously injuring Azzopardi's husband through negligence. He denies the charges. Mildred Azzopardi, 62, from Ħamrun, a mother of four, died at the scene on July 27 when Chetcuti's car ploughed into her car as she put items in the boot. The 23-year-old accused joined the AFM as a recruit in January and on June 10 had his passing out ceremony and was confirmed as a gunner. He was posted to the Maritime Squadron on July 1. Police superintendent Nicholas Vella from the Road Policing Unit testified on how the accident happened at Xatt il-Barrieri, where the Azzopardis had earlier been fishing. Vella played out footage from ten CCTV cameras, explaining that the accused drove around Fort St Elmo initially at 36km/hr. His Subaru Impresa could then be seen at a speed of 246.33/m in nine seconds, meaning an average speed of 98 km/hr. The superintendent said Alfred Azzopardi, the victim's husband, was already in their Ford Fiesta while Mildred was putting some stuff away in the boot when the crash took place. CCTV footage taken from the offices of shipping companies in the area showed the Subaru Impresa arriving at a high speed before the driver lost control and it swerved, hitting Mildred Azzopardi' car first. Azzopardi died on the spot.  Medicolegal expert Mario Scerri testified that Mildred Azzopardi sustained several bone fractures and internal haemorrhage. Her husband suffered  grievous injuries and was in intensive care for a while. He added that Chetcuti tested negative for drugs. His urine sample was sent to another expert for further testing. Medicolegal experts Ali Sarfraz and David Pisani took the witness stand and testified jointly on the findings of the post-mortem examination which showed that Mildred Azzopardi suffered multiple injuries. An eyewitness also took the stand on Tuesday morning. Reeves Cini explained that at the time of the incident he was at the nearby Siege Bell Memorial. “When I arrived on site I found Benjamin,” the witness said, clarifying that he knew the accused from the time the latter worked in Valletta. The road had already been closed. The witness said he feared the worst since his grandfather owned a boathouse in the area. He asked Chectuti if he wanted something to drink, and ran up to his home and got him a soft drink from the fridge. Chetcuti told him: “I was coming from Pixxkerija (fishmarket) side when I lost control of the vehicle and crashed into the cars.”",12/08/2025,2025-08-12 09:15:31.60137+00,27/07/2025 22:00,TRUE,Ta' Liesse,Valletta,1,Fatal,Car,23,M

490742,National Alcohol Policy lacks measures to address drink-driving: Insurers,"The Insurance Association Malta raised its concerns that the new National Alcohol Policy lacks any robust enforcement measures to address drink-driving.  ""With the island still reeling from a tragic number of road fatalities, it is disappointing that proven measures, such as random breath testing and mandatory alcohol testing after accidents, remain absent,"" the Association said in a press release on Monday. The statement comes after Magistrate Joe Mifsud called for random roadside alcohol and drug testing of drivers, after a fatal Senglea motorcycle crash, which took place in June, revealed the rider had cocaine in his system.  The National Alcohol Policy was launched in June to reduce alcohol consumption in the population through ""evidence-based strategies"". The Association said it welcomed the policy's release for public consultation, but raised its concern that the publication, which was delayed by 17 months, is a signal of the authorities' lack of urgency, and how it left out a dedicated section on drink-driving found in the 2018-2023 policy.   The Association pointed to the policy's own data showing that alcohol consumption in Malta rose by 23 per cent between 2010 and 2019, while the European average fell by roughly the same percentage. Almost half of those aged 20 to 49 admit to drinking more than six glasses of alcohol each week.  “The policy acknowledges rising alcohol use across all age groups, yet remains practically silent on the sanctions and enforcement that are crucial to deterring repeat offenders. Education alone is the carrot, but without the stick of enforcement, it will not be enough,” IAM said.  The Association urged the government to follow the lead of other European countries, which were implementing tougher laws to curb drink-driving, including random roadside checks and stricter penalties, such as higher fines and licence suspensions.  It also called for mandatory reporting of driving-under-the-influence cases to insurers. It also called for the introduction of Alcolock devices, a breathalyser installed in a vehicle that would prevent the engine from starting if the driver is over the legal limit. It also suggested introducing subsidised taxi services during large events, coupled with campaigns to promote designated drivers. Finally, it suggested greater use of CCTV footage to identify and deter dangerous behaviour on the roads.  “Educating drivers on the risks is vital, but it must be matched by strong deterrents that make repeat offences far less likely,” IAM said.  The statement comes following a spate of serious road accidents in recent weeks, several linked to drink-driving. The Association also called on the authorities to ensure that the new National Alcohol Policy delivered meaningful change, warning that ""without decisive measures, Malta risks relegating this policy to another missed opportunity, and drink-driving will remain a deadly, preventable threat on our roads” In July, AFM soldier Benjamin Chetcuti was allegedly five times over the alcohol limit when his car hit 62-year-old Mildred Azzopardi in Valletta, killing her and injuring her husband. The test returned a positive result of 139.2 μg/100ml when the legal limit is 22micrograms. On August 10, food courier Khim Bahadur Pun, 42, from Nepal, was killed when his motorcycle was hit by a car driven by a 17-year-old in Santa Venera.The youth fled the scene but was arrested five hours later.

490697,"Magistrate urges random alcohol, drug tests after fatal biker crash","A magistrate has called for random roadside alcohol and drug testing of drivers, after a fatal Senglea motorcycle crash revealed the rider had cocaine in his system. Magistrate Joe Mifsud made the recommendation following a magisterial inquiry into the June accident on Triq ix-Xatt Juan B. Azopardo. The 43-year-old motorcyclist lost control, struck a bollard and was killed on the spot. No one else was injured. Toxicology tests conducted during the autopsy found traces of cocaine in his system. In his concluding remarks, Mifsud said that “while it seems that disciplinary measures have started being taken while driving, enforcement needs to increase and officials should be conscious of their role in protecting lives”. He stressed that while discipline has never killed anyone, substance abuse has, with the victims sometimes being innocent, law-abiding citizens who suffer due to the abuse of others. The magistrate urged better coordination between the authorities and constant, rather than sporadic, law enforcement presence on the roads. He referred to a 2023 position paper co-written by NGO Doctors For Road Safety, the Maltese Association of Psychiatry and the Foundation for Welfare Services on drug-driving under the influence of psychoactive drugs.  The paper states that “the use of psychoactive drugs can result in impaired driving skills, leading to an increased risk of road traffic crashes. “It is important to note that the most common psychoactive drugs involved in driving crashes are often taken for recreational purposes, although prescription drugs such as benzodiazepines and opioids can also impair driving skills.” Mifsud endorsed each of the paper’s eight recommendations, including the introduction of a legal framework to enable random drug testing for psychoactive substances, as well as the random screening of professional drivers, such as taxi, school bus, coach and heavy machinery drivers. The paper also called for the establishment of clear guidelines regarding acceptable substance levels in the body while driving, and the review and updating of existing legislation to include penalties for the combined use of drugs and alcohol to reflect the increased risk to road safety. Many European countries allow random or targeted random roadside testing for alcohol or drugs. In the UK, Germany and Malta, the police need “reasonable suspicion” to conduct tests. The Maltese magistrate’s call comes amid a spate of serious road accidents in recent weeks, several linked to drink-driving. In July, AFM soldier Benjamin Chetcuti was allegedly five times over the alcohol limit when his car hit 62-year-old Mildred Azzopardi in Valletta, killing her and injuring her husband. The test returned a positive result of 139.2 μg/100ml when the legal limit is 22micrograms. On August 10, food courier Khim Bahadur Pun, 42, from Nepal, was killed when his motorcycle was hit by a car driven by a 17-year-old in Santa Venera. The youth fled the scene but was arrested five hours later. Police said a breathalyser test found he was over the legal alcohol limit. And earlier this month, a taxi crashed into a hair salon in Santa Venera. The owner, who was outside at the time, was unhurt.

490746,"Drunk cab driver was waiting for passengers before crash into salon, court hears","A cab driver who was over the legal alcohol limit when he crashed into a Santa Venera hair salon told police he had been waiting for passengers, a court has heard. Abdi Salaan Mahamad Abditon Ali had a reading of 107.3 micrograms of alcohol per 100 ml breath, when the legal limit for cab drivers is zero, after the crash into Marica’s Salon, on Cannon Road, on August 7. A court on Monday heard that he gave a statement to police, in which he said he was waiting for passengers just before the collision. ""Thank God no one requested a cab… It could have resulted in fatalities,” police inspector Nathan Bugeja told the court.   The 42-year-old Somali national stands accused of driving in a negligent, dangerous and reckless manner, causing damage to third property, and driving under influence. He denies the charges. The salon was still closed at the time of the incident and there were no injuries. A police constable testified about receiving a call regarding the collision, with the initial information stating that the vehicle had crashed into a “house”. When the witness got onsite, he found the owner, Marica Baldacchino, who had not seen the incident. The witness went to Mater Dei Hospital where he spoke to the driver. He returned back when another constable was subjecting the driver to the a breathalyzer test. The constable underlined that a cab driver’s limit is 0 μg/100ml. During Monday’s sitting, the prosecution and defence made submissions on bail. Police inspector Bugeja objected due to the seriousness of the crime.  Bugeja also highlighted that although the man’s address on his official documents and the charge sheet state that he lives in St Paul’s Bay, the police accompanied him to a Ħamrun address to collect his passport. Defence lawyer Francesca Zarb counter-argued that the defendant has been in Malta since 2008 and this was his first brush with the law. He was granted subsidiary protection and has a residence permit. The lawyer observed that the court as presided hears cases on traffic collisions and argued that individuals with the same charges are brought before it under summons not under arrest. Zarb also argued that whether the man is granted bail or otherwise, the amount of damages would not be affected. Bugeja rebutted the argument stating that usually collisions do not involve third parties, nor do they involve damages running into thousands of euros. While an exact figure was not given during Monday’s sitting, the damages sustained are between €10,000 to €15,000. These will be confirmed once the salon owner takes the stand. The police inspector also added that the man poses a risk to the public. Zarb observed that two of Ali’s friends were present in the courtroom, with one of them willing to host him. The friend told the court that he came to Malta in 2006 and has known the accused for the past eight years. The court then asked the accused whether he held a bank account, signalling it was willing to grant bail, only if a bank guarantee could be made. After establishing that Ali lacked a bank account with a local bank through which he could guarantee at least €10,000 in favour of the victim, the court denied the man bail. In its decision, the court held that it does not have the peace of mind he would be able to satisfy all conditions otherwise imposed by the court in a bail decree, even though at this stage, the man is presumed innocent until proven guilty. The case continues later this month.

490945,Transport Malta unveils traffic management plan for smaller SiGMA conference,"Transport Malta revealed its traffic management plan for SiGMA's annual conference, which is expected to have fewer attendees this year.  This year’s event will take place from 1 to 3 September at the Malta Maritime Hub (MMH). Unlike previous year’s this will not be SiGMA’s main event, it will be a smaller event that is expected to attract 15,000 people. The main event is being held in Milan this year. Last year, SiGMA’s main conference attracted around 27,000 delegates. This large event drew criticism for exacerbating traffic congestion, particularly around Marsa, where the conference was held. Despite the complaints, the Traffic Ministry had insisted that its traffic management plan worked. During a media briefing on Wednesday, Transport Malta CEO Kurt Farrugia reiterated that last year's plan worked well, and overall, TM plans on implementing a very similar traffic management plan. The main difference is that more TM officials will be deployed on the first day of the event, and the white taxi drop-off and pick-up point has moved. Just like last year, TM plans on implementing a geo-fenced area for ride-hailing cabs, meaning that Y-plate taxis will not be able to drop off or pick up anyone within the general area of the event. Instead, ride-hailing cabs will have a designated pick-up and drop-off spot, on the other side of Triq il-Labour in ONE News’ parking lot. Attendees will have to walk for about five minutes and cross the bridge over the main road to reach the event. White taxis will have a separate drop-off and pick-up zone located along the road in front of Identità’s office. Chauffeur-driven cabs will use Addolorata Cemetery’s parking area as private parking for their cabs. While anyone catching a coach or mini-bus will be dropped off and picked up on Triq tat-Tromba, which is a seven-minute walk from the venue. Otherwise, staff personnel will have their own designated parking closer to the venue. Besides these different zones, TM officials will be patrolling the area and making use of drones to best monitor the traffic. In an interview with Times of Malta last year, prime minister Robert Abela said that the Malta Maritime Hub is not a viable venue and pledged to find a better venue to host this conference. This is the third consecutive year that the MMH will be used as SiGMA's venue.",20/08/2025,2025-08-20 10:33:10.112227+00,20/08/2025 0:00,FALSE,,,,,,,

Police are only equipped with alcohol breathalysers.  In a statement published on Tuesday, MHRA said it backed a call by emergency doctor Jonathan Joslin, who called for random testing of motorists in a Times of Malta opinion piece published on Monday.  Joslin warned MPs that if they did not revise the law, they would have to bear moral responsibility for any ensuing road deaths in which drugs or alcohol are involved.  The MHRA called for the government and MPs to heed Joslin's call, highlighting how the ""time for action is now"". ""MHRA stresses that for a country like Malta, where tourism is a cornerstone of the economy, safety is not opitional, it is essential,"" the statement read. The Insurance Association Malta has also backed the doctor's call for random drug and alcohol testing of motorists.  ""A safe environment on our roads is just as important as the quality of our hotels, restaurants, and attractions. Tourists choose destinations where they can enjoy themselves with peace of mind, and residents deserve the same assurance every day."" MHRA said that random roadside testing would send a clear message that the country people can visit confidently and enjoy responsibly.  ""Such measures do not restrict enjoyment, they raise the standard of living and hospitality for everyone.""  The past few weeks have seen a string of road accidents and deaths linked to drink-driving.  On Monday, a woman involved in a collision that left a motorcyclist critically injured on Sunday was six times over the legal alcohol limit at the time.  In another recent case, a 42-year-old food courier from Nepal was killed when his motorcycle was hit by a Maserati car in Santa Venera. A 17-year-old driver was later charged after fleeing the scene, and pleaded not guilty to driving under the influence.  Mother-of-four Mildred Azzopardi was killed when she was caught between two cars after a car driven by a soldier crashed into a stationary vehicle in Valletta.

Police are only equipped with alcohol breathalysers.  Calls for a change in legislation have been amplified in recent weeks following a series of fatal or serious crashes involving alcohol or drug-impaired drivers.   The association referred to “alarming” data compiled in 2022 by the Insurance Association Malta, which is also in favour of random testing, that revealed breathalyser tests were only used in around three per cent of serious traffic accidents.  “This data clearly highlights the need for a revision in the current legislation,” ACE said.  The organisation referred to a recent opinion piece published in Times of Malta by emergency doctor Jonathan Joslin, who wrote that members of parliament would bear moral responsibility for future road deaths involving drugs and alcohol should the law remain unchanged. ACE added that it also supported calls by Caritas for strict ID card checks in supermarkets, groceries and catering establishments.  “Above all, ACE also supports the recent call for a public education campaign aimed at clarifying the risks associated with alcohol consumption and driving to remind the public that any amount of alcohol in the bloodstream can impair their ability to drive safely.”  The association stressed that road safety is a collective effort which calls on government, legislators, political parties, civil society and individuals to ensure safer roads, better enforcement and fewer deaths.  On Monday, the Malta Hotels and Restaurants Association also came out in support of revising laws to allow police to conduct random substance testing.  ""MHRA stresses that for a country like Malta, where tourism is a cornerstone of the economy, safety is not optional; it is essential,"" the association said.  In a recent inquiry into the death of a motorcyclist who was found to have cocaine in his system, Magistrate Joe Mifsud endorsed a 2023 position paper co-written by NGO Doctors For Road Safety, the Maltese Association of Psychiatry and the Foundation for Welfare Services on drug-driving under the influence of psychoactive drugs.   Mifsud endorsed each of the paper’s eight recommendations, including the introduction of a legal framework to enable random drug testing for psychoactive substances, as well as the random screening of professional drivers, such as taxi, school bus, coach and heavy machinery drivers.",21/08/2025,2025-08-21 10:01:56.907884+00,18/08/2025 0:00,FALSE,,,,,,,

The car driver was four times over the alcohol limit.  Michael Spiteri, who was attending to the first call out of the day at just before 6am on Thursday in the wake of the Sliema accident, warned this could ""have ended in tragedy"". “Irresponsible drivers are putting innocent lives at risk. It is obvious that some are refusing to learn, so the only way forward is random and frequent checks, harsh penalties, and highly visible enforcement to deter this reckless behaviour.

491134,Watch: Parents ‘still in the dark’ on rock fall that killed daughter,"The parents of Mirabelle Falzon, who died last year when she was hit by falling rocks at a popular swimming spot in Marsascala, say they are still in the dark about the exact circumstances of her death. The accident happened on July 19, 2024, when Falzon and her friends were sunbathing in the area of Munxar, beneath the ruins of an 18th-century military battery known as Riħama. Speaking to Times of Malta, Falzon’s parents, Michael and Charmaine, said that while they have heard from government sources that the magisterial inquiry into their daughter’s death has likely been concluded, they are none the wiser as to whether this is true.   Mirabelle’s noisiness was a core part of her character. “She would be in the yard with her boyfriend, and I’d tell her, ‘Does everyone need to know what you’re saying?’ She was always laughing, bringing joy wherever she went. Now the house is silent without her,” Charmaine said. On the one-year anniversary of Mirabelle’s death, her parents organised a mass in her honour. “I can’t thank people enough for coming. The place was packed – everyone still loves her.” Finally, Mirabelle’s father said he had just one request to the authorities. “When someone brings something to your attention, don’t let months and years go by before action is taken. If you save just one life, it’s enough. This is a small country – things shouldn’t fall on deaf ears. No one is infallible and it’s impossible for everything to be perfect, but there are things we could be doing better.” Questions sent to the attorney general’s office regarding the magisterial inquiry remained unanswered at the time of writing.",22/08/2025,2025-08-22 05:32:33.146671+00,22/08/2025 0:00,FALSE,,,,,,,

491258,We spent three terrible years waiting for our dad to die',"A sudden cardiac arrest shattered the life of Paul Scicluna, a healthy and happy retired father in 2021. The event plunged him into a vegetative state from which doctors said he would never recover and for three years his family endured a painful vigil, watching him fade away, waiting for him to die. Less than a year after Paul Scicluna’s death, two of his children – Kevin and Marilyn – have decided to open up to advocate for a more inclusive euthanasia law, believing that their father should have had the choice of a dignified end. They told Times of Malta their father would have benefitted from the option, and that the government’s proposed criteria are too narrow to have helped him.  he could have donated his organs, because they were all still working perfectly after the accident,” Marilyn said. “But the principles of the law as proposed by the government wouldn’t even have made our dad eligible for it.” “We’re not saying a euthanasia law should force people to opt for it,” Kevin said. “But if someone is going through something like our situation and they feel like it makes sense to them, then why take it away from them?” Kevin and Marilyn said they, too, would create a living will if given the option, a document that would allow them to specify their wishes for end-of-life care. “That way, at least we know that if we’re ever in a situation like that, we have a living will that can speak for us,” Marilyn said. “My dad didn’t deserve to die like that.”",23/08/2025,2025-08-23 05:05:30.422284+00,23/08/2025 0:00,FALSE,,,,,,,

491371,Robert Abela announces ongoing revision of drink-drug driving penalties,"The government is revising penalties for drink and drug driving, Robert Abela said on Sunday. “There is an ongoing exercise to determine if the penalties are sufficient for these sort of crimes. If you ask me, I think there should be a serious revision,” Abela said in a broadcast interview.  “It’s time to have a deterrent... there will be serious penalties. You will be taken to court and will be convicted on the parameters of the penalties  A Wolt courier, Khim Bahadur Pun, died on August 10 after a 17-year-old (who cannot be named by court order) allegedly ploughed into him. The teenager, who is accused of running away from the scene, was also allegedly found to be above the legal limit. On Thursday, a motorist who crashed head-on into a bus on Tower Road in Sliema was four times over the alcohol limit. The man pleaded guilty to driving recklessly while under the influence. That crash had no fatalities. Several emergency doctors have called for stiffer penalties for drink and drug driving, as well as random testing.  The Nationalist Party has said it will be proposing a private member’s bill for “zero tolerance” for accidents caused by drivers who are found to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs. The Insurance Association Malta and the Association of Catering Establishments have also called for random roadside checks and stricter penalties. Magistrate Joe Mifsud called for random roadside alcohol and drug testing of drivers, after a fatal Senglea motorcycle crash revealed the rider had cocaine in his system. Replying to questions by One News editor Josef Caruana on Sunday, Abela said that besides legislation, there will be stricter enforcement by increasing the presence of police, Transport Malta, and LESA officials on the road.

491380,Joslin insists on random testing as PM says drink-drive penalties may be raised,"Emergency doctor Jonathan Joslin on Sunday reiterated his call for random testing of motorists for alcohol and drugs after the prime minister said penalties were being revised, but did not mention roadside testing. At present motorists are only tested after accidents or when there is 'reasonable suspicion' that they may be driving under the influence. ""Random Testing is the true deterrent in decreasing injury and death on Malta’s roads,"" Joslin, leading consultant at the Mater Dei emergency department, wrote in a Facebook post.  ""While higher fines and stronger punishments may act as one layer of deterrence, experts insist that the real game-changer lies in random roadside alcohol and drug testing. This must be applied before a collision happens, not only after injury or death has occurred. ""Protection, not reaction, must be the guiding principle. Drivers must understand that the risk of being caught under the influence does not depend solely on the tragic aftermath of a crash. It must be clear, publicly and categorically, that anyone can be stopped at any time, tested on the spot, and face serious legal consequences if found guilty,"" the doctor stressed. He said the prime minister's reform must therefore ensure that random roadside testing for all vehicles becomes the central deterrent.  ""Only then will Malta send the strongest possible message: if you drive under the influence, you will be caught – and the consequences will be severe. Several groups have over the past weeks called for roadside random testing after a spate of accidents linked to driving under the influence. Among them were the Insurance Association, the Malta Hotels and Catering Establishments, the Association of Catering Establishments (ACE).

Joslin was at the forefront insisting that random testing would be a more effective deterrent to prevent serious traffic accidents than the reactive imposition of higher penalties to those who cause such crashes.

491738,Random roadside drugs and alcohol testing 'significant step forward',"The Malta Hotels and Restaurants Association on Wednesday “strongly supported” random roadside testing for drugs and alcohol saying it will have a positive impact on Malta's reputation as a safe tourism destination. The association said the introduction of random roadside testing is a “significant step forward” in addressing reckless behaviour on the roads and protecting lives. “These measures are not only essential for upholding the rule of law but also for reinforcing Malta’s international reputation as a safe and welcoming destination,” the MHRA said. Prime Minister Robert Abela and Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri announced on Tuesday announced that police will be given the power to randomly test drivers for alcohol or drugs while laws will be revised to ensure anyone involved in fatal crashes while driving under the influence is sent to prison.   Recognising that safety and security are “decisive success factors” for Malta as a “quality tourism destination”, the MHRA said tourists and residents must feel assured that Malta provides a safe and orderly environment, free from risks that undermine wellbeing and public trust. The association stressed that better sustainable tourism management is “inseparable” from responsible enforcement and strong deterrents against behaviour that endanger society. “These reforms will help ensure a higher standard of living for residents and the local community, while delivering outstanding, safe experiences for even the most discerning tourists,” the MHRA added.",27/08/2025,2025-08-27 09:30:11.285579+00,26/08/2025 0:00,FALSE,,,,,,,
491926,"GWU backs tougher sentences for drug and alcohol driving, urges more testing","The General Workers’ Union (GWU) has backed recent proposals for tougher sentences on drivers caught driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. The union also called for more frequent random testing of motorists, which it said, together with tougher penalties, would improve road safety and discipline. The statement follows the announcement of a proposed bill earlier this week, empowering police to carry out random drug and alcohol testing of motorists without the need for prior suspicion. The proposals, unveiled Tuesday by Prime Minister Robert Abela and Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri, will also see motorists who cause a person’s death while driving under the influence handed a mandatory prison sentence. In a statement, the GWU said it “strongly endorses” the proposals for tougher sentences, with union general secretary Josef Bugeja saying it was “neither appropriate nor fair for someone to lose their life due to the reckless actions of others”. “We have witnessed too many accidental deaths on our roads, often caused by individuals under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of the incident”, he said. “It is essential to foster a culture of discipline in our country and implement strong reforms to create more deterrents for those who drive irresponsibly. Such individuals pose a danger not only to themselves but also to others, and their actions can tragically lead to loss of life.” Bugeja also highlighted the need for “increased roadblocks at various times” to conduct random testing of motorists, as part of efforts to enhance safety on the roads. The recent proposals were welcomed by the PN, emergency doctor Jonathan Joslin – who has repeatedly called for random testing of motorists – Doctors for Road Safety and the Malta Hotels and Restaurants Association. The announcement came in the wake of a spate of horrifying road accidents this summer. Police caught four drunk drivers during roadside inspections carried out overnight between Tuesday and Wednesday in Żebbuġ, Marsa, Msida, and St Julian’s.",28/08/2025,2025-08-28 12:58:29.699011+00,28/08/2025 0:00,FALSE,,,,,,,
491890,Man killed by electric shock identified as Charles Mifsud,"A man who died by electric shock on Wednesday near Golden Bay has been identified as Charles Mifsud. Mifsud, 41, was a resident of Żebbuġ. He died after being electrocuted while working on an electricity pole, falling into a ditch as a result of the accident. It remains unclear what Mifsud was working on at the time of his death. It is also not yet known whether he was self-employed or working for a company. Until a few years ago, he was a fruit and vegetable vendor in Żebbuġ and was well-known in the community. Residents of Żebbuġ took to social media on Thursday to express their ""shock"" and condolences, with people stating that he was a ""true gentleman”. The accident occurred at around 12.30pm on Wednesday in Triq Palma, near Golden Bay. He was assisted by rescuers from the Civil Protection Department and an ambulance crew but died later in hospital. Magistrate Joe Mifsud is leading an inquiry. Police and the Occupational Health and Safety Authority are investigating.

492029,Skip and run: truck smashes Rabat balcony and flees,"A truck hit the balcony of a Rabat home and kept going without stopping - and the property owner says it is the second time a truck has damaged the house. The balcony subsequently had to be dismantled as it was deemed unsafe following the impact.  Cyril Spiteri Staines and his wife received a call from ""shocked"" neighbours just after 9pm on Wednesday, who told them a truck had hit their Rabat property and kept going.  Neighbours told them they saw the vehicle responsible but did not note its number plate as it was too dark to see.  “I am more angry than shocked. This savage just breaks our property and drives off like nothing happened,” said Spiteri Staines, 53. Neighbours described the truck as a skiploader without a skip on the back.  The couple live in St Julian's and the Rabat property is currently unoccupied.   Police and Civil Protection Department officials arrived on site shortly after being informed. A report was filed and, after assessing the damage, authorities decided the balcony was too dangerous to leave standing. It was pulled down shortly afterwards. “I tip my hat to the authorities; they did an outstanding job on our end,” said Spiteri Staines.    “Unbelievably, this isn’t even the first time that our house was hit by a truck,” he added. Spiteri Staines explained that around a decade ago, the same house, but on the side facing Triq Tal-Virtù, was damaged when a truck carrying animal feed crashed into it. That time, the driver took responsibility. He said he hoped the outcome this time would be the same. “If the person who crashed into our place was in any way a responsible person, they would have stopped to assess the damage and take accountability, but they didn’t. So now we want them caught and for them to fix the damage.” He is appealing to anyone who may have witnessed the incident or has CCTV footage to contact him at cspiteristaines@gmail.com.",29/08/2025,2025-08-29 09:45:22.303555+00,27/08/2025 0:00,FALSE,none,Rabat,0,not injured,skiploader,none,none

493121,"Minimum three years’ jail for drunk, drugged drivers guilty of manslaughter","A driver found guilty of mans-laughter while under the influence of drugs or alcohol will face a minimum sentence of three years’ effective imprisonment, according to draft legislation. The government had previously announced mandatory prison sentences for involuntary homicide if a driver kills someone either while over the alcohol limit or with any drugs in their system. The recently published draft legislation, and soon to be debated in parliament, establishes a minimum sentence. “Where an offence against sub-article 1 or 2 (involuntary homicide) is committed by reason of the offender having driven a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, a minimum punishment of three years’ imprisonment shall apply in every case,” the draft legislation reads. Currently, the law imposes a maximum sentence of four years’ imprisonment if a person is killed out of negligence, and a 10-year sentence if more than one is killed or injured. The draft law further explicitly states that the judiciary cannot provide a lesser punishment than the minimum sentence. It also adds that the Probation Act cannot apply in cases of drink or drug driving. Last week, the government announced it plans to start random roadside testing for drink and drug driving. It also announced its intention to introduce mandatory prison sentences for behind-the-wheel manslaughter if the driver was over the alcohol limit or had drugs in their system.   When the law is in force, the police will be equipped with handheld drug tests, which check for the seven types of illegal drugs and their derivatives. To conduct the test, the police officer needs to scrape the driver’s tongue with a swab, which is then inserted into a plastic holder before being inserted into the testing device. If there is a positive result, the next step is to take another sample to confirm the results – this time via a saliva swab that is tested in a lab. However, the draft legislation published last week also accounts for cases when a driver is unconscious following an accident. In such circumstances, where a driver cannot consent to an oral exam, the police, following a magistrate’s order, will have the power to conduct a blood test. The blood test, conducted by a medical professional, will only happen following a magistrate’s order, the law states. “The idea is that if a driver is unconscious or unable to give the oral exam, or cannot give consent for the exam, there is still something to test if drugs or alcohol are in the system,” according to a source working on the legislation. Another provision requires prosecutors to request that an accused’s driver’s licence be suspended if they are facing charges of vehicular manslaughter. “The decree of the Court of Magistrates shall be immediately enforceable but shall be subject to an appeal by an application filed within five (5) days before the Criminal Court,” the proposed law states. The court’s decision may be revised and/or made subject to conditions the court deems fit. The legislation is being pushed after a series of road incidents sparked by drink or drug driving this summer, some of which have been fatal. The Authority for the Responsible Use of Cannabis is in favour of the government’s drive to introduce roadside alcohol and drug testing. But it has recommended that roadside drug testing focus on whether a driver is under the effects of cannabis, rather than whether there is any trace of it in the body, because “it is impairment that poses a real risk to road safety”.",09/09/2025,2025-09-09 04:46:37.467455+00,09/09/2025 0:00,FALSE,,,,,,,
493212,Birkirkara aqueduct arch collapses after traffic accident – council,"An aqueduct arch in Birkirkara collapsed after a traffic accident in the area, the local council said Tuesday evening, while calling for swift repair works ahead of the beginning of the new scholastic year. In a statement, the council said, “some weeks ago, one of the arches of the historic aqueduct located in our locality collapsed due to a traffic accident that occurred in the area”. While no further details about the accident were provided, in July part of the historic Wignacourt aqueduct in Mrieħel was closed off for checks after a truck hit one of the arches as it joined the Rabat road. An architect was appointed by the Superintendence of Cultural Heritage to evaluate and prepare a report on the damage, with repair works to be carried out “by the relevant authorities”, the council said.  “The council wishes to emphasise that it is not within its remit to carry out these works, nor does it hold any legal or technical responsibility for the repair of the arch”, it said. “Nevertheless, the council has been actively and continuously putting pressure and engaging to ensure that these works are undertaken as soon as possible.” The council said the pending repairs were “particularly important” due to the new school year starting later this month, with it “very aware of the traffic pressure that already exists in the area – pressure that has increased due to the closure of this arch”. It “strongly appealed” to authorities ""to make every effort to ensure that the necessary works are carried out without further delay"". The Birkirkara community and residents “deserve a serious and immediate solution to this inconvenience that has persisted for too long”, the council said. The aqueduct was built on the orders of Grand Master Wignacourt, for whom it is named, to carry water from springs in Dingli and Rabat to Valletta. It was inaugurated in April 1615. This is not the first time the historic structure was damaged; in August 2018, one of the arches was damaged when the driver of a large concrete-mix truck ignored traffic signs and tried to drive through, damaging the central corbel stone of the arch. The council statement was signed by mayor Desirei Grech and executive secretary Christine-Jo Mansueto.",09/09/2025,2025-09-09 20:01:09.002407+00,09/09/2025 0:00,TRUE,Wignacourt Aqueduct,Birkirkara,none,not injured,van,none,none
493223,No entry sign put up at Mġiebaħ Bay as danger looms right on top of bathers,"The Public Works authorities on Tuesday evening placed a ‘Danger no entry’ warning sign at Mġiebaħ Bay, hours after Times of Malta queried a lack of safety measures in place and four months after a government report identified unstable rock formations as a “significant risk to public safety”.  The report had said that action should be taken “as soon as possible to prevent any avoidable incidents”.  It remains unclear whether any further safety measures will follow the placement of the no-entry sign. Mġiebaħ Bay, in Mellieħa’s Selmun area, is a swimming spot favoured by those wanting to avoid crowds. Pictures posted on social media and others taken by Times of Malta show deep cracks in rock formations just above a flat, clay part of Mġiebaħ that is popular with bathers.  Frenki Dragan Crnjakovic, who flagged the issue on the Facebook group ‘The BEST of Malta’, said he highlighted the issue last year. “A huge chunk of rock is waiting for its moment to crash into the sea.

I believe that it will also reach the official services that will mark or fence off these dangerous areas,” he said.  Mellieħa mayor Gabriel Micallef said he first reported the issue to the police and several government entities last April. He pointed to a particular rock formation that seemed close to dislodging onto the crowd. By May, a report commissioned by the police and drawn up by the Public Works Department’s Project Design and Engineering Directorate confirmed the danger. “It has been observed that large boulders are gradually becoming dislodged due to ongoing coastal erosion,” the report, dated May 9, says. “This natural process is giving rise to areas that pose a significant risk to public safety, especially as the summer season approaches and the bay is expected to attract a high number of visitors for sunbathing and swimming,” it says. The report said that, besides the cracks in the rock formation highlighted by Micallef, other rock formations in other parts of the bay were dangerous. “In view of the above, I strongly recommend that a qualified geotechnical engineer be urgently commissioned to carry out a comprehensive assessment of the site. The objective of this evaluation should be to identify zones of potential danger and advise on any necessary mitigation measures,” the report says. “Given the imminent increase in public use of this location, this assessment should be undertaken as soon as possible to prevent any avoidable incidents.” Correspondence provided to Times of Malta by the Mellieħa mayor shows that the Lands Authority was alerted to the problem. Micallef said that the last communication he had from the authority was in June, when the Lands Authority and the council agreed to install danger signs. “Kindly note that danger signs have been ordered and I will update you with the date of installation,” the e-mail, dated June 24, said. Questions have been sent to the lands ministry. Last year, 22-year-old Mirabelle Falzon died when she was hit by falling rocks at a popular spot in an area known as Munxar, in the limits of St Thomas Bay. The ruins of an 18th-century military battery, known as Riħama, are perched on the cliff overlooking the site. After the incident, several signs were put up, warning that swimming in the area is prohibited, and a fence was erected around the battery itself.  A magisterial inquiry into the tragedy said reports about the dangerous state of the coastal battery in Marsascala, made in the months and years before the collapse killed Falzon, were lost in the bureaucracy of government entities.  The magistrate recommended that a single entity should be responsible for receiving reports about state-owned and private buildings, as well as abandoned buildings and structures like bastions and cliffs that presented a danger to the public. In a statement reacting to the conclusions, the government said it will be implementing the court’s recommendation for there to be one entity “that will receive reports about government buildings or private buildings, as well as about walls, cliffs, or abandoned buildings that pose a danger to the public”.",10/09/2025,2025-09-10 06:06:18.32888+00,09/09/2025 0:00,FALSE,,,,,,,

493340,Watch: ‘Animals are treated better than us construction workers’,"Restrictive road closure rules are forcing construction workers to start late and work through the hottest part of the day, contractors say. Veteran contractor Albert Tanti, who has been in the building business for nearly four decades, criticised current Transport Malta regulations, telling Times of Malta that “animals are treated better than construction workers” because while horses are banned from working during peak hours, protections for construction workers are much weaker.   Transport Malta sticks to its guns Transport Malta has no intention of changing the regulations. In a reply to questions, a spokesperson defended the authority’s policy, arguing the 9.30am restriction is essential to reduce traffic congestion “during peak morning hours when thousands commute to work, school or to obtain other services”. “Closing residential streets earlier would risk significant disruption to traffic flow and limit emergency access,” he said. He said the authority does, however, consider exceptions on a case-by-case basis. In areas where a closure wouldn’t affect schools or traffic flow, a permit might be granted for an earlier start.  He said the authority is open to discussing specific cases with contractors to find practical solutions. “Where possible, Transport Malta seeks to assist works through measures such as temporary permits, phased closures or coordination with local councils to balance community needs and workers’ safety,” he said. But Tanti and the building contractors’ association argue that due to the policy, workers often do not begin work until 11am – the hottest part of the day – due to the time it takes to set up and get materials on site. He said starting work later also means they must finish later. Working at night would hardly solve the problem and would create even more inconveniences for residents, he added. Allowing contractors to close side streets at 7am would be in everyone’s best interest, including the neighbours, he insisted, because the site would be completed earlier. And even with an earlier permit, they would not be able to start the actual work before 8am anyway, giving commuters a clear window before they leave for work, he said.",11/09/2025,2025-09-11 08:57:09.346024+00,11/09/2025 7:00,FALSE,,,,,,,
493542,Watch: The moment car crashes into Marsa building,"Four men escaped injury when the driver lost control of his car and smashed into the facade of a building in Marsa causing some damage. The incident happened on Friday afternoon in Triq Isouard when CCTV footage captured a Mercedes driving round a corner at the top of the street, swerving across the opposite lane and crashing with some speed, climbing the pavement and into the facade of a private residence.  Just seconds earlier, a woman was walking in the street on the opposite side of the road but she stepped off the road and onto the safety of the pavement just as the car crashed into the building opposite. The Mercedes also hit the back of a Citroen parked outside the building, shoving it slightly forward. The four men climbed out of the vehicle seemingly unharmed as they surveyed the extensive damage caused both to the front of the car and to the facade. Stones were seen falling off the facade after the impact. It is not yet known if the owners of the residence were at home at the time of the accident. LESA CEO Svetlick Flores said ""this is normal business for us to see a collision involving a vehicle and a building or a fence"".

493570,"€25,000 licence surrender scheme planned for ‘coming weeks’","The government initiative to pay drivers €25,000 to give up their licence is set to come into effect within “a matter of weeks” and will target young people, Transport Minister Chris Bonett said. “I’m hoping that, in a few weeks, we will be announcing it. It’s not going to take months; it’s a matter of some finishing touches,” the minister said. Bonett announced the ‘Surrender Your Licence’ scheme in March, explaining that it will offer car drivers an annual payment of €5,000 for five years in exchange for giving up their driving licence during that period. At the time, he set himself a deadline of the end of June. However, at the end of June, Bonett said the scheme was yet to be finalised.  The transport minister said the government’s plan to reduce traffic, announced earlier this year, is still under way. Yesterday, Bonett also gave an update on plans for a new ferry connection to Gozo from Sliema and St Paul’s Bay. In July, the minister announced that the government had issued a call for a tender, adding that the year-round  service was expected to start “between the middle and end of August”. But the ambitious plan to launch the fast ferry service this summer ran aground after a ferry company complained that the tender included deadlines and conditions that go against EU rules. Yesterday, Bonett said the tender objections meant the process had to stop until the Public Contracts Review Board ruled on the matter. He said a sitting of the board is set for October 9. “I would love to tell you that the service will begin from tomorrow because we are ready to go. But now, we must allow justice and good governance to proceed.”",13/09/2025,2025-09-13 04:34:10.092265+00,12/09/2025 0:00,FALSE,,,,,,,

493920,Tougher measures against reckless drivers go before parliament,"A bill to introduce random testing of motorists for drug and alcohol abuse went before parliament on Tuesday, with the Home Affairs Minister insisting that the changes had been in the works for some months. Calls for tougher legislation reached a crescendo this summer following a spate of traffic accidents in which the motorists involved were found to have been driving under the influence of drink or drugs. But Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri told the House that the government had declared its intention to beef up the laws even before parliament rose for the summer recess. ""We want to send a clear message to motorists that they cannot, through their actions, put others in danger,"" he said.  Motorists and pedestrians who observed the law deserved protection, he said, and while one could not control what everybody did or did not do, this legislation would serve as a stronger deterrent. Going into the provisions of the law, Camilleri said that henceforth, the police would be able to test motorists for drug abuse in the same way as they did for alcohol. And tests could be carried out randomly and not upon 'reasonable suspicion' as had been the case to date for drink-driving. Limits were not being changed, the minister said, but there would be 'zero tolerance' for anyone driving under the influence of illegal drugs such as cocaine or heroin. The minister pointed out that during talks with a number of organisations, concerns had been raised about how this new approach could negatively affect people taking medical cannabis who were perfectly fit to drive but could still be caught up in the tests. Similarly, people who took recreational cannabis days previously could also be caught up. There was also a risk that people would  not take medicines prescribed by doctors for fear of being caught up in drug tests.  A well-researched document had been handed to the government and was being seriously considered.  The purpose of the new law was to ensure that everyone was responsible behind the wheel and to deter only those who were unfit to drive. But there would be zero tolerance of those who were reckless and prepared to put other people's lives in danger. No risks could be taken, which was why random testing was now also being introduced.   The minister said the police had bought new, modern test kits for drug testing. The procedure to be followed was that in the case of a positive drug test, a follow-up test would be taken to confirm the result. The new law also provided that when a traffic accident resulted in a fatality, the motorist would be sentenced to jail if convicted of having been driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. The possibility of a suspended sentence was being removed. Stiffer fines There would also be stiffer fines for those found to be driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol. The purpose was to strengthen the deterrent against those who, through their recklessness, risked injuring or killing somebody. A fine which previously stood at €1,800 was now being raised to €2,500 for a first offence. In a repeat offence, the current fine of €3,000 was being raised to €5,000. Furthermore, prosecutors may request immediate suspension of a motorist's driving licence, not when proceedings are completed. The law was also introducing stiffer penalties in hit-and-run cases.  In his address Camilleri said this was not the first time that the government was taking tough action to ensure that traffic laws were observed. Penalties for contraventions that could put people's lives in danger had actually been doubled in 2023. But strengthening the law had to be accompanied by actual enforcement, and this was happening too, with just the police having mounted 1,300 road checks this year up to August. Action would increase even more now that the police had a specialised Road Policing Unit.  10,000 found driving while on the phone this year  Action by the police and others such as LESA was not just focused on drink and drug driving. This year, up to August,10,000 fines were issued against motorists found using mobile phones at the wheel. 38,000 had been fined for this offence since 2022. All these people, clearly, were prepared to drive in a manner which endangered others, despite heavy fines, the minister said.  This underlined the need for educational campaigns to underscore the point that people should not put other people's lives at risk. ""The message is clear, the mobile phone can wait and if you drink or take drugs, your place is not behind the steering wheel,"" Camilleri said. ""Do not play with people's lives"".",16/09/2025,2025-09-16 15:04:54.616951+00,16/09/2025 0:00,FALSE,,,,,,,

Mohamed Hamdan, 46, appeared in court yesterday to face a string of driving offences  over a January incident in St Paul’s Bay, in which he allegedly rammed his truck into a car following a traffic dispute. The incident, caught on camera and exclusively revealed by Times of Malta, involved Hamdan allegedly attempting to park his truck to make a water delivery to a hotel. Police inspector Warren Galea told the court that the alleged victim, driving a red Mazda, had overtaken Hamdan and blocked his access to the designated delivery spot on Triq it-Turisti.   The two men exited their vehicles and initially exchanged words. The situation quickly escalated, and a passenger had to intervene to separate them. Hamdan then returned to his truck and drove into the Mazda, which was later declared a total loss. Three other parked vehicles were also extensively damaged. The court heard that the accused was arrested at the time but released on police bail until February 26, pending the submission of medical documentation by the alleged victim. Despite repeated visits by Hamdan to the Qawra police station to seek updates, the requested documents were not submitted until March. The alleged victim presented a medical certificate and vehicle damage valuation report, both dated January. Hamdan also sustained a scratch, which was certified as slight injuries. Hamdan was called back to the police station on April 15. He requested to have his lawyer, Nicholas Mifsud, present before any interrogation. However, inspector Galea explained that due to Mifsud’s involvement in a high-profile jury case, the interview was postponed. Before a new date could be set, the fatal Bidnija shooting occurred. Hamdan was arrested and charged with murdering Jean Paul Busuttil in yet another traffic dispute. Given the circumstances, police decided to file the earlier road rage charges on July 4 without conducting a formal interrogation. Hamdan pleaded not guilty to wilful damage to a car, slightly injuring the driver, damaging three parked cars through negligent and reckless driving, dangerous driving and recidivism. The alleged victim took the stand yesterday. Cautioned that he could face charges himself, the man chose to testify. He said he had been collecting employees from the Buġibba Hotel at around 6.30am when Hamdan’s truck reversed towards him. He claimed he tried to manoeuvre around the truck, asking Hamdan to let him pass so the latter could park. The witness described Hamdan exiting the truck and allegedly swearing and trying to punch him. He said his employees stepped in to defuse the situation, and as he returned to close the back passenger door, Hamdan drove his truck into his car and then several others.

494379,Bidnija ‘nightmare’ roadworks drag on past June deadline as residents fume,"Residents are frustrated that works to rebuild Bidnija’s main road have been ongoing since January, despite an initial June deadline. Infrastructure Malta (IM) attributed the delays mainly to the installation of new sewage pipes. Mosta mayor Joseph Gatt told Times of Malta such setbacks are common in large projects, particularly since no works had been carried out on this road for 30 years. He said the reconstruction should finally be completed within a “maximum” of two weeks. For nine months, IM has been rebuilding Triq il-Bidnija, which is the main road connecting the village to Mosta. A noticeboard on site states that the project was scheduled to last 18 weeks from its start on January 30, meaning it should have been completed by early June. Residents who spoke to Times of Malta on condition of anonymity complained about the inconvenience caused by the delay. Up until Friday, drivers entering Bidnija from Mosta were allowed to pass through Triq il-Bidnija via a one-way lane. However, residents leaving the village to go towards Mosta were forced to use a narrow concrete country road. Traffic lights were also put up to help direct the traffic. After Times of Malta sent questions to IM, a resident said the traffic lights were taken down and Triq il-Bidnija was opened up for two-way traffic. Works are still ongoing further up the road towards Bidnija church.  Despite the progress, a resident said the roadworks have “been moving slowly for a considerable number of months”. Apart from causing inconvenience, a resident said the unfinished road generates a lot of dust, which was even making its way into his home. “It has been a nightmare,” the resident said. “Every time a car passes, it raises a cloud of dust that even enters our homes. With school about to start, the traffic and health concerns will only get worse.” The resident added that a rela­tive of theirs suffered from bad hay fever attacks. “There is so much dust. When I drive through, I cannot even see what’s behind me. The least they could do is spray some water on the road to reduce the amount of dust,” another resident suggested. Yesterday, after Times of Malta sent questions to IM, workers doused the road with water. In a statement, IM said “works included the deep trenching for a new sewer trunk main and the addition of a new sewer rising main along the site. This factor has substantially compromised the final completion period of works, being in the critical path of the project.” Besides this, IM said that as the contractor was instructed to open one lane on the road, this further delayed the project.

The free tow truck service for stalled vehicles has also been extended during peak times.  A new Park-and-Ride route running from Ta’ Qali to Mater Dei hospital and the University of Malta's Msida campus has also been introduced.

495152,Watch: This is what students say would get them to vote,"If there were an election tomorrow, 16- and 17-year-old students who spoke to Times of Malta said they want political parties to give more priority to Maltese people and solve traffic problems by prioritising public and alternative modes of transport. The election of Alex Borg as the new leader of the opposition has shifted the political landscape. He told Times Talk that his plan is to target the vote of young people who feel disenfranchised by politics. In light of this and rumours of an early general election circling, Times of Malta visited GF Abela Junior College during Freshers’ Week on Thursday to ask students what types of policies would encourage them to go out and vote. “I would vote for the party that promises to make Malta, Malta again,” one student said, adding that the ongoing development and the new buildings emerging lack a sense of Maltese identity and culture. Another student shared similar views, stressing the importance of safeguarding Maltese identity and cultural heritage. “We need to stay united as a country, especially with the number of tourists that are coming to our country,” he said, adding that it is important to maintain our traditions like feasts. Malta is ‘overcrowded’ Like him, other students said tourism had taken precedence. One student described the quality of tourists Malta is attracting as “horrendous”. “Malta’s really changed. Due to high levels of tourism, certain places have to be more avoidable,” one student said. Someone else said Malta had become “overcrowded”. Students shared these thoughts following a summer when tensions surrounding “overtourism” escalated.  “Since there are a lot of tourists and immigrants, everything is getting more expensive and it’s putting us teenagers at a disadvantage,” she said. Just like her, another student called for “liveable wages”. “The prices of everything keep on going up and the wages remain the same and it’s becoming too costly to actually enjoy yourself while you’re living,” she said. Traffic…  Responses showed that improving the public transport system and reducing traffic remains a hot topic for young people. “It’s a bit difficult to get to school because of bus times and delays. I think we just need more bus stops in general,” one student said. Apart from buses, one student called for the implementation of the metro, which the prime minister has recently hinted at again after having been quietly shelved. Rather than improving public transport, other students called for policies that steer away from car use. “I think that cars shouldn’t be allowed in Malta, given Malta’s small size,” one student said. Students also called for infrastructure that supports alternative modes of transport as well as creating more green open spaces.",29/09/2025,2025-09-29 09:58:15.93842+00,25/09/2025 0:00,FALSE,,,,,,,
495320,Woman cleared of causing collision with six parked cars,"A court has cleared a woman of crashing a car into six parked vehicles after the prosecution failed to prove she was the driver. The incident happened in Naxxar Road, Birkirkara, on March 19, 2022. Esther Mifsud was arraigned before Magistrate Yana Micallef Stafrace and accused of dangerous and reckless driving, damaging the six parked cars due to negligence, and driving under the influence of alcohol. She denied the charges. The court observed that affidavits presented in court were “inconclusive” and “confusing” as to who was actually driving the vehicle at the time of the incident. It pointed out that jurisprudence laid down that the evidence on identity needs to be “clear” and “unequivocal”. In this case the prosecution failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was driving the vehicle at the time of the incident and that she was driving under the influence. It was also noted that while the police had alleged that bodycam used by officers on the scene was switched on at the time of the incident, footage was never presented in court. “Had this evidence been presented, it would clearly have helped the court to identify the person behind the wheel,” Magistrate Yana Micallef Stafrace said.

495731,Autopsy results of Croatia car tragedy victims expected on Monday,"Autopsy results of the two couples who died when their rental car plunged into the sea while on holiday in Croatia will be published on Monday.  Croatian sources told Times of Malta the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Rijeka, which is carrying out the autopsies, will have details of the results on Monday.  Jeremy Gambin, 68, and his wife Lorraine, 67, died alongside Kevin Bonnici, 67, and his wife Alexandra, 66. They were travelling together on the scenic Adriatic Coast when the car they were in veered off the road and into the sea on Thursday afternoon. The four were good friends and all lived in Swieqi.  Autopsy results could help shed light on the dynamics of the crash, with Croatian media having reported that the initial suspicion is that the person driving the vehicle may have become ill while driving, leading to the crash.   Jeremy Gambin was a basketball coach at Luxol and a former player who represented Malta at the 1987 Games of Small States of Europe in Monaco. He was also a PE Teacher at St Michael’s Foundation. He and his wife Lorraine, whose official name is Cynthia, had three children and several grandchildren.   Kevin Bonnici worked in the cab business and served as a company director of two separate Y-Plate fleet firms. He previously worked for Air Malta in the airline's finance, flight ops and engineering departments. He and his wife Alexandra had two children and various grandchildren.   Sources told Times of Malta that family members were travelling to Croatia on Saturday, and forensics will continue with the autopsy.  The accident happened at 4.20pm on Thursday, on the D8 state road near Bunica, just south of Senj. Police said the vehicle, travelling from Rijeka towards Senj, is believed to have lost control on a left-hand bend, veered right, struck two stone barriers and fell around 70 metres down a ravine before ending up in the water. Police officer Jasmin Mujaković from the Senj Police Station was among the first to arrive at the scene of the horrific accident, 24sata reported. He surfaced several times for air and then went down under the surface again, trying to find a way to reach the victims. A Croatian diver with over 30 years of experience has described Thursday’s fatal car accident that killed four Maltese tourists as the most difficult intervention of his career.

495802,Husband’s vigil for wife in coma after crash that claimed unborn baby,"A 29-year-old woman has been in a coma for almost three months after she was hit by a car while five months pregnant – an accident that also claimed the life of her unborn son. Tonamol Baby, an Indian national, was struck on July 16 and has remained in Mater Dei Hospital’s neurosurgical ward since. Her husband, Jacob Tom, visits her daily, gently speaking to her and holding her hand – a quiet routine that began after the crash that changed everything for the couple. “It’s our first baby. A boy,” says Tom, 34. “Unfortunately, July 20 was my birthday, and my boy passed on July 19.” He paused before adding, “I don’t feel angry. I feel sad.” Tom, a man of small build, smiles as he steps away from his wife for a few minutes to walk out of the ward for the interview. He sits on a blue chair in the waiting room and places two mobile phones on the chair beside him: he carries her mobile around with him. He has been there since 8am. This is where he spends his days – up until it’s time for him to go to work at 6pm. “I am near her every day. In Malta, I am alone. I want to take her home to India. I think having family will help her get better faster,” he says. This is why he has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise the money he needs to take his wife back home, where she can be surrounded by family and continue her care. But this will cost about €50,000, which he cannot afford. An accident that changed everything  Tom came to Malta four years ago and initially worked as a bartender. After completing several courses, he became a sommelier and now works with the db Group. He got married to Tonamol, who he met in the area they are from, Kerala in the South of India. They married three years ago, and she moved to Malta a year later, initially working as a carer at Mater Dei Hospital. After she obtained her bridge course, she became a nurse and was based at St Vincent de Paul Residence. Tom usually joined her on her commute to work every day. “I will wake up when she gets ready for the duty and we take the bus from Buġibba where we live. After I drop her off, I will come to sleep,” he says.  Holding on to hope Doctors told him there was no hope. They did not expect her to make it beyond 48 hours. But she did. And now days became weeks and months. “She is still in a coma state, but she is totally different now. I can see almost the same face. She started to open her eyes. There is eye contact, but she is still not responding. There has been miniature progress from the first day but, for me, there were big changes,” he says, insisting that he is hopeful. He spends his day near her. For over a month, he did not report to work. But he has now decided to return – for his mental health and to earn the money he needs. “Recently I started working – my company, which I belong to, are very supportive. Every day I'm here… I’m away from here just for work. I work from 6pm to 1am. I get home at 3am. By 8am I am near her until it's time to go to work,” he says. But here in Malta he has no family support. This is why he would like to take his wife back to India where she will be provided with care for her condition and surrounded by family. But getting her home is too expensive. She would have to be transported in a medical ambulance for the cost of €20,000 and the hospital care is estimated to cost another €30,000. “I will be with her for a couple of months. Then, I hope, she will be okay, and I will bring her back with me.” Anyone who would like to help Tom take his wife home to India can access the crowdfunding page https://gogetfunding.com/prayers-and-support-needed-for-tonamol-babys-recovery/",05/10/2025,2025-10-05 08:42:00.989689+00,05/10/2025 18:00,FALSE,none,none,1,Serious,car,none,none
495896,Couples killed in Croatia travelled together for 30 years without an accident,"The two Maltese couples killed when their car plunged into the sea in Croatia last Thursday had been travelling together for more than 30 years and had never experienced a single accident. The victims – Jeremy and Lorraine Gambin and Kevin and Sandra Bonnici – were lifelong friends and cousins who regularly holidayed together across Europe and beyond. “They were not only cousins but best friends who travelled all over the world together. They’ve driven around together for tens of thousands of kilometres,” Justin Gambin, one of the victims’ sons told Times of Malta. The fatal crash occurred on the D8 state road near Bunica, close to the coastal town of Senj, when their rented car struck two stone barriers and fell some 70 metres into the sea below. Croatian emergency divers described the recovery operation as one of the most difficult they had ever carried out.  Relatives of the victims, including their children, are currently in Senj, where on Monday they laid flowers near the crash site in memory of their loved ones. In their first comments to the media since the tragedy, the Gambin and Bonnici families expressed deep gratitude to the Croatian authorities and local community for the “incredible support” shown in the aftermath of the tragedy.  All the victims’ personal belongings have since been returned to the families who are now waiting for the autopsy results.  Meanwhile, questions have been raised about the safety of the D8 road, where certain stretches lack adequate barriers to prevent cars from plunging into the sea below. ""While the stone bollards along the road may appear protective, they were likely insufficient to prevent a vehicle from veering off the road,” said Jonathan Gambin, whose 68-year-old brother was among the victims. Gambin said the family hopes that further investigations into the accident will bring some kind of closure.  The tragedy shocked Malta and is believed to be the highest death toll of a crash involving Maltese nationals abroad.  It came almost exactly a month after another Maltese couple, Doris and Manuel Buhagiar, were killed in a car crash in Sicily.",06/10/2025,2025-10-06 13:11:20.300815+00,02/10/2025 0:00,FALSE,D8 state road,Senj,1,Fatal,Car,68,M

495942,Traffic collision case collapses over identification failure and police error,"A St Paul’s Bay man accused of causing a traffic collision has been acquitted after the alleged victim failed to identify him in court and police failed to follow proper procedures during the investigation. Dennis Attard, 49, of Triq l-Imsida, Santa Venera, faced five charges stemming from a collision on 23 September 2024 in Triq Censu Tabone, St Paul’s Bay, including reckless driving, causing involuntary damage, driving without a licence, driving an unlicensed vehicle, and driving without insurance. The case centred on a collision between Attard’s vehicle and a motorcycle ridden by Marland Herman Jones. Jones told the court he was riding down a narrow street when a car “just kind of jumped in” and pulled out in front of him. “I braked as hard as I could but I hit the I believe his door or the front right quarter panel,” he testified, adding that he “just kind of fell over and jumped up cursing.” Jones explained that the driver claimed he had to leave urgently because “his daughter was giving birth.” They exchanged phone numbers via WhatsApp, but when Jones attempted to contact him, he received no response despite seeing the messages had been viewed. “I tried to contact him again, no answer. He viewed the I saw it through the messaging app. I could tell that he watched it,” Jones testified. However, when asked to identify the accused in court, Jones admitted: “Actually at at this date I can’t recognize him in court, if this is the gentleman, I don’t quite recognize him, I have to be honest.” He explained he had identified someone at the police station “over 8 months ago” but “couldn’t tell you now.” The defence suggested Jones had hit the car from behind, but Jones firmly rejected this, stating repeatedly: “That’d be completely incorrect” and “That’d be incredibly incorrect.” Magistrate Yana Micallef Stafrace dismissed all charges on Monday, ruling that Jones “did not recognise the accused in Court” and noting his claimed identification at the police station “does not result from the police affidavit.” Moreover, the court found that “on the day of the collision the right to silence was not administered to the accused as required by law.” Court therefore concluded that “the evidence does not provide beyond reasonable doubt all the elements of the crime, and therefore the imputations have not been proven to the degree required in the criminal field.” Attard chose not to testify and was acquitted of all charges.",06/10/2025,2025-10-06 20:22:06.418272+00,23/09/2024 0:00,TRUE,Triq Censu Tabone,St Paul’s Bay,0,not injured,Car,49,M

496060,Watch: Partial building collapse in central Madrid injures three and leaves four missing,"A partial building collapse in central Madrid has injured at least three construction workers and left four others unaccounted for, emergency officials confirmed on Tuesday. The incident occurred at a renovation site near Plaza Mayor, a busy area in the heart of the Spanish capital. Search underway for missing workers Firefighters and rescue teams were deployed immediately after several floors of the building gave way, causing a cascade collapse that reached the basement level. According to Francisco Martín Aguirre, the central government’s representative in the Madrid region, the damage was “very severe”, and assessments were underway to determine whether neighbouring buildings had been compromised. Deputy Mayor Inmaculada Sanz said that search efforts were ongoing for four missing individuals, three men and one woman. Emergency responders were using drones to scan the wreckage while nearby properties were being evacuated as a precaution. Initial reports from Madrid’s emergency services indicated that three workers had sustained injuries, none of which were serious. Mayor José Luis Martínez-Almeida later confirmed that one of the injured had been taken to hospital. Earlier estimates from Martín Aguirre suggested that up to 10 people might have been hurt, but municipal authorities later revised the figure down to three. Emergency officials maintained that all injuries were minor. Witness accounts The collapse sent shockwaves through the surrounding streets. Witnesses described hearing a powerful explosion before a massive cloud of dust engulfed the area. “There was an enormous blast that shattered all the glass,” said Milagros García Benito, who works at a nearby hair salon. “You couldn’t see a thing, everything was white. Then the firefighters and police arrived almost immediately.” Police cordoned off the site, which was soon filled with ambulances, fire engines, and emergency personnel as crowds of onlookers gathered. Sanz warned that the rescue and stabilisation work would be extensive, stating that “the amount of rubble is very significant” and that operations “will last quite some time, possibly several days”. The building, originally an office block, was being converted into a hotel after receiving planning approval from Madrid City Hall in February. Land registry data lists the structure as a six-storey property covering roughly 6,745 square metres (about 73,000 square feet). Investigation underway Authorities have not yet determined the cause of the collapse. Engineers and safety inspectors were expected to begin a detailed assessment once rescue operations concluded. The Madrid municipal police said surrounding buildings would remain evacuated until stability could be guaranteed. Emergency services continue to work at the site, prioritising the search for the missing workers amid concerns about further structural instability.",07/10/2025,2025-10-07 19:32:49.766643+00,07/10/2025 0:00,FALSE,,,,,,,

495969,"Husband of injured nurse thanks donors as fundraiser hits €70,000 in two days","A crowdfunding campaign for a nurse left in a coma after a car crash that killed her unborn baby has raised more than €70,000 in two days. Tonamol Baby, 28, was five months pregnant when she was struck by a car while crossing the road to start her shift as a nurse at Mount Carmel Hospital on July 16. She lost her baby and has been in hospital ever since, while her 34-year-old husband Tom Jacob spends his days by her side, far from their home in Kerala, India. Tom turned to Times of Malta to share the couple’s story as he set up a crowdfunding campaign for an air ambulance to take her home.  The cost of the medical flight is around €20,000 and the hospital costs would be at least another €30,000.  Tom daily arrives at the neurosurgical ward at Mater Dei Hospital at 8am to sit by the bedside of his wife of three years, staying until he leaves for work at 6pm. He is employed as a sommelier with the db Group. He thanked everyone who contributed, including the db Group and “the db family”, the Healthmark team (Tona’s employers), the Kerala federations and Tonamol’s friends. “Words cannot fully express our gratitude. To each and every person who contributed, shared our story, or kept us in their thoughts, thank you from the bottom of our hearts. “Your kindness has given us hope and strength during one of the most difficult times of our lives. We assure you that all of you will be remembered in our prayers always. And we kindly ask you to continue keeping us in yours, more than anything, we need your prayers,” he said. On the day of the accident, Tom was having a cup of tea at the couple’s home in Buġibba when a friend called him with the news about his wife’s accident.  As she crossed the road, a car struck her right pelvic bone and, as she fell to the ground, her head hit a bollard. When Tom arrived at the hospital, he did not recognise his wife at first. Since then, however, he has seen an improvement and hopes she can recover at home in Kerala, surrounded by family. “I will be with her for a couple of months. Then, I hope, she will be okay and I will bring her back with me,” Tom said.",07/10/2025,2025-10-07 09:09:28.614696+00,16/07/2025 0:00,TRUE,Mount Carmel Hospital,Ħ'Attard,1,Serious,car,none,none
496068,Taxi driver knocked out in road rage attack: 'Just asked him politely to move',"A taxi driver was left unconscious after being repeatedly punched in the head in an apparent road rage incident in Paceville. Motiraj Paudel suffered head injuries in what witnesses described as an unprovoked attack in the early hours of Sunday, at the corner of Triq San Ġorġ and Triq L. Apap. The 43-year-old from Nepal said he was driving along the road when he found it blocked by a badly parked white Mercedes “half on the pavement and half in the road”. “When I told the driver he was parked illegally, he and another man got out of the car and one of them punched me three or four times in the head,” Paudel told Times of Malta. He was knocked out and, after coming to his senses a minute later, a group of women who had witnessed the assault called an ambulance, which took him to Mater Dei Hospital for treatment. “The [taxi] driver was completely peaceful and did nothing to provoke the attack,” a shocked witness said. “We went to the police station immediately to report what we saw but they did not ask for any ID or contact details,” she added. A police spokesperson said a report had not been filed at the time of writing but the victim said he thought his medical report would be sent to the police. Paudel, who was forced to take time off work due to his injuries, said he had been living in Malta for the past six years. 'Racist insults but never a physical assault' He said that, in his four years working as a bus driver and two years as a taxi driver, he had experienced occasional racist insults but never a physical assault. “I just asked him politely to move. This isn’t how you should resolve problems in a civilised country,” he said. The incident follows another reported case of road rage that occurred two days prior, in which three people were involved in a brawl in the middle of Triq Manwel Dimech, in Sliema. Those involved ultimately chose not to pursue the matter with a police report, opting instead to apologise.

496158,Bodies of Croatian crash victims to be flown home on Friday,"The families of the two couples killed in a horrific road crash in Croatia are preparing to bring their loved ones home on Friday. Jeremy and Lorraine Gambin and their best friends Kevin and Sandra Bonnici were killed last Thursday when their Land Rover Discovery plunged off a cliff and veered into the sea on the D8 state road near Bunica, just south of Senj. The funeral of the Gambin couple will be held on Saturday at Balluta church at 9.30am, the victims' son Justin Gambin told Times of Malta. The date of the funeral of the other couple is not yet known.  The four - aged between 66 and 68 - were lifelong friends who regularly holidayed abroad together. In a statement to Times of Malta, the Gambin family said: ""Jeremy and Lorraine, humble and loved by all, lived life to the fullest. They left us doing what they loved most with their best friends."" Drowning most likely cause of death Meanwhile, autopsy results reported by Croatian media say drowning was the most likely cause of death of the two couples, as only slight injuries were found on the bodies. All four are believed to have been wearing seatbelts. Forensic investigations are ongoing with experts unable to determine what caused the car to veer off the road. Initial reports in the Croatian media that the driver of the vehicle may have become ill while driving, thus leading to the crash, were not verified by the autopsy. The vehicle fell around 70 metres after veering off the road, before crashing into the sea to a depth of at least 11 metres. The investigation was conducted by forensic medicine specialists from the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Rijeka. Relatives of the four victims, including their children, laid flowers near the crash site in memory of their loved ones.  Justin Gambin said his father and Kevin Bonnici were “not only cousins but best friends who travelled all over the world together. They’ve driven around together for tens of thousands of kilometres”. Speaking to Times of Malta on Wednesday, he thanked the Croatian police in Senj for their assistance.  Questions on safety of road Meanwhile, questions have been raised about the safety of the D8 road, where certain stretches lack adequate barriers to prevent cars from plunging into the sea below. Jonathan Gambin, whose brother was among the victims, said that while stone bollards along the road “may appear protective, they were likely insufficient to prevent a vehicle from veering off the road”. He had expressed hope that further investigations into the accident would bring the victims’ relatives a measure of closure. It is not known whether the Senj Bora, the notorious strong northeasterly wind that blows along the Adriatic coast of Croatia, could have potentially contributed to the accident. There has also been some speculation in the Croatian media that an oncoming car could also have distracted the Maltese driver.  Croatian emergency divers described the operation to recover the car involved in the crash as one of the most difficult they had ever carried out, with experienced diver Renato Huba telling local media that while he had prepared for the worst, “this was much worse”. A member of the towing service praised a policeman who was among the first to arrive on the scene and who dived into the water in an attempt to open the door of the car damaged by the force of impact. ""He tried everything he could. He jumped, dived, tried to open the door, but due to the extensive damage and the strong water pressure, it was simply not possible.

496154,"23 crashes, 10 breakdowns and two spillages: Tuesday sees extra bad traffic","Traffic congestion and gridlocks were particularly bad on Tuesday, a day that also registered an abnormally high number of accidents. Motorists reported spending more than double the usual time on their commutes on Tuesday, and many took to social media to express frustration, complaining about standstill traffic that stretched even onto non-arterial roads. In a Facebook post, Transport Malta said there were 23 collisions, 10 vehicle breakdowns and two separate spillages across the island on Tuesday. It said calls for assistance were more numerous than other days, and its officers were much busier trying to solve the gridlocks. And those are just the cases Transport Malta assisted in, and do not include accidents that were reported to LESA. However, it is unclear whether the traffic jams were linked to the high number of accidents.  Transport Malta constantly monitors the roads using scores of cameras scattered around the island, and it employs officers on foot, motorbikes and in cars to patrol and clear the roads whenever accidents occur. To ensure roads are cleared as quickly as possible, officers - and sometimes whole units - are immediately deployed to the scene of a crash or breakdown, or when heavy vehicles spill hazardous fluids, materials, or chemicals. Traffic frustration On Tuesday, several motorists on social media said a journey from Sliema to Marsa took up to 1.5 hours, the short hop from Ta' Xbiex to Msida was an hour-long ordeal, the route from San Ġwann to Msida lasted 45 minutes, and drivers travelling from the Three Cities to Attard spent 1.5 hours stuck in traffic.  Key hotspots throughout the day included the St. Paul’s Bay bypass, with heavy congestion along the Coast Road and in St Julian's. Furthermore, traffic was especially bad in Paola, Marsa's Aldo Moro Road, the Marsa/Ħamrun bypass and Regional Road. Major traffic was also reported on most roads leading in and out of the Gżira, Ta’ Xbiex, and Msida area, with vehicles barely moving. Parliament drama The day's traffic woes even spilled into an impromptu banter session in parliament later that day between Prime Minister Robert Abela and Opposition Leader Alex Borg. The drama began when government whip Naomi Cachia accused the opposition of raising a procedural issue simply to buy time for Borg to arrive, as he was running late. Borg eventually arrived mid-way through Abela’s speech. When he took the floor, he told the Prime Minister he was delayed because, unlike Abela, he was stuck in traffic as he doesn't have an escort. Abela quickly hit back, telling Borg he ""better had his licence and insurance paid"". This was a reference to a recent incident involving Borg's partner, Sarah Bajada, who was caught driving without a valid vehicle licence and insurance.",08/10/2025,2025-10-08 15:45:33.237115+00,07/10/2025 0:00,FALSE,,,,,,,

A month earlier, an Italian man also died after getting into difficulty at the same location.  Two drownings occurred in July. A 67-year old from Munxar was found unconscious in the sea at Xlendi, while on the same day a 25-year old Nepalese man also died at Exiles in Sliema.  Several diving accidents were also reported. Dione Galdes, an experienced instructor, died on July 1 after experiencing difficulties during a dive in Ċirkewwa three days prior.  A 54-year-old German diver also died in September, while another diver was reported missing in May.   Two children died of drowning in swimming pools within the space of a few weeks. On June 22, a six-year-old child drowned in a Naxxar swimming pool on after wandering away from his relatives.  And on July 26, 16-month-old Noah Mizzi died after falling into a pool at a residence on Triq in Xagħra.   According to police figures, 14 people died by drowning in 2024, up from seven in 2023.   More to follow.",08/10/2025,2025-10-08 13:44:49.322134+00,08/10/2025 13:00,FALSE,,,,,,,
496206,Watch: Traffic accident caught live on air during live Transport Malta interview,"Malta’s traffic woes were brought home to TV viewers live on air after a minor accident was caught on camera during a roadside TVM interview with a Transport Malta official. The footage shows a silver vehicle crashing into the back of a red car in front as the latter stops at a Paola roundabout, as Transport Malta’s (TM) deputy head of enforcement Jean Claude Attard is interviewed in the foreground live on TVM. Attard appears startled at the sound of the accident before looking around to the scene of the bumper-to-bumper in the background, while the presenter continues speaking. The accident occurred just moments after the presenter said the pair were “here in the early hours of the morning, when traffic seems to be at its peak – which is normal for the country”.  Reacting to the incident, Attard tells the presenter: “As you can see, these things happen on the go, as behind us, we have a bumper-to-bumper which can take a while to clear the vehicles from the street”. He added that TM officials would “place markers on the ground of where the crash happened to move the cars as fast as possible” in addition to their duties directing traffic at what he described as “one of the busiest junctions in the south”. TM officials can be seen attending the scene shortly after the incident occurs. Thursday’s on-air accident comes as Malta continues to battle perennial congestion and frustration on the roads.

A 19-year old man also from Nadur was riding pillion. A Toyota Corolla driven by a 67-year old man from Qala and an Alfa Romeo driven by a 55-year old man from Munxar were also damaged in the collision. A medical team was called on site and an ambulance took the 43-year old man and the 19-year old youth to the Gozo General Hospital for treatment. Magistrate Brigitte Sultana appointed an inquiry as police investigations continued.  Writing in a social media post following the accident, Għajnsielem mayor Kevin Cauchi expressed his frustration at the lack of inaction following the latest accident on this stretch of road. “Another serious accident took place this morning on Triq l-Imġarr. The statistics speak for themselves yet still nothing is being done,” he said. He pointed out the local council has been appealing with the authority “for years” to install speed cameras, plastic bollards and other traffic calming measures along Triq l- Imġarr and other main roads.",10/10/2025,2025-10-10 12:22:30.72069+00,10/10/2025 9:00,TRUE,Triq l-Imġarr,Għajnsielem,0,not injured,car,55,M
496574,Watch: Msida flyover to open by end of year as final steal structure installed,"The Msida flyover will open by the end of the year, Transport Minister Chris Bonett said, as the last steel structure forming the flyover at Msida Creek was installed on Sunday morning. The sixth and final steel piece measures 18 metres in length and weighs around 25.5 tonnes. “The flyover will allow us to create a new open space in the heart of Msida, while we will also be constructing a canal to help alleviate the flooding problem that is synonymous with this area,” Bonett said.  The Transport Minister said the project progressed at a fast pace, adding that a new bridge connecting Msida to Pietà will open to traffic in the coming weeks. Infrastructure Malta CEO Steve Ellul explained that the works on this project are being carried out in a way that minimises inconvenience as much as possible — both for residents and for those who travel through the area by car. “Major works that require traffic diversions are being carried out during weekends or at night, with clear communication in advance to ensure the project’s successful implementation,” Ellul said.",12/10/2025,2025-10-12 16:57:00.930159+00,12/10/2025 0:00,FALSE,,,,,,,

496577,Traffic overtakes cost of living to become people's single biggest concern,"Traffic, parking and public transport-related issues are now Malta’s biggest headache, and by a large margin. New poll data published by Times of Malta suggests frustration with traffic-related issues has reached new heights, with people citing them as both the country’s biggest problem as well as the biggest hassle in their own personal lives.  And while irregular migration numbers are at record lows, many still cited 'asylum seekers' as the country's biggest problem. When coupled with mentions of 'illegal immigration', the issue ranks among the top concerns for people both on a national and individual level, cutting across party lines.  Concerns about corruption, which in previous years were regularly cited as a major national issue, appear to have waned and people are now more likely to cite the environment as a major issue  Senior citizens, on the other hand, appear to be the most satisfied citizens of all: 22.1 per cent were unable to name a single biggest problem impacting their life at the moment.",13/10/2025,2025-10-13 05:03:22.837075+00,13/10/2025 0:00,FALSE,,,,,,,
496733,Employer cleared of responsibility for young worker's death,"A court has sharply criticised the police and the Occupational Health and Safety Authority for not working together to properly establish the facts which led to the death of young worker Matthew Bartolo in the accident at Constructure Furniture 10 years ago. Magistrate Claire Stafrace Zammit made her comments as Construct Furniture director John Agius, floor manager Amanda Cefai and foreman James Cefai were acquitted of involuntary homicide. Agius was convicted of having engaged Bartolo without undertaking a risk assessment and fined €7,000.  All the accused were acquitted of failing to keep proper records, perjury, suppressing the evidence of a crime, and providing false information to the Occupational Health and Safety Authority (OHSA). Agius was also acquitted of recidivism.  The court in its considerations said that the prosecution in such cases needed to prove that there was a link between an alleged shortcoming by the accused and the employee, and that their acts of commission or omission caused the fatal incident. While Agius was the director of the company which engaged Bartolo on January 12, 2025, there was no evidence that Bartolo was employed by the Cefais. All that transpired from the evidence was that they were both at the factory when the fatal incident occurred. A court-appointed expert had reported that the machine did not have any issues. In its judgement, the court said it did not understand how the prosecution did not consider the conclusions of the court-appointed expert, and did not take criminal action against Nick Bellizzi, the engineer who certified the machine in 2012, and who should have carried out a risk assessment of the full machine.  It was clear that Bellizzi was responsible for the health and safety of the machinery, with the prosecution having failed to show whether Construct Furniture had a health and safety officer. From the evidence it emerged that Agius was working on the basis of instructions issued by Bellizzi. Had there been any shortcomings, the accused was not alerted to them by the engineer.  The court also noted that Agius had installed a safety barrier to the machine out of his own will, showing that he was “serious” in his work, contrary to Bellizzi.  It therefore acquitted all three accused of the main charge of involuntary homicide. It also acquitted the Cefais of the charges related to health and safety, finding that there was no contractual link between them and the victim. With regards to Agius, the court said the situation was different since there was an employment contract. While Agius made use of Bellizzi’s services, he was not exonerated from his own duties. During the proceedings no documents were presented to show that Bartolo had undergone medical tests before being employed. It also emerged that the instructions on how to use the machine were not observed prior to the incident, with the court referring to the conclusions of a technical expert. In his testimony, Agius had said that Bartolo could have sought to place the wood on the machine in a better manner. Instead of stopping the machine altogether, he had jumped over the barrier and slipped.  On the basis of the available instructions to workers, the court ruled that Agius had done his utmost to ensure a safe working environment. Blundell should have been answerable to the shortcomings and not Agius, the court said. Agius was found guilty of employing Bartolo without a prior risk assessment  and without ensuring that he was assigned adequate work. The trio were acquitted of forging Bartolo’s signature on the employment contract, with the court noting that the court-appointed expert was never asked to carry out a comparative exercise on Bartolo’s signatures. Nor had the prosecution proven that the accused were making use of a fake employment contract. Agius was also not found guilty of recidivism after the prosecution did not present the judgement by which he had been found guilty earlier. This was the second prosecution in connection with the case. In 2023 David Peter Blundell, 50, who had been working alongside the 17-year old, was acquitted of failing to take all necessary health and safety measures during the operation of the machine. He was cleared of responsibility for the death. The court in its latest sentence rapped the prosecution and the Occupational Health and Safety Authority for not having worked together in the investigations of this case to establish what happened that led to Bartolo’s death. Despite so many years having passed, the court said it still did not have a clear picture of the unfortunate accident that led to the loss of life of someone just started out in life. “This court hopes that nowadays the two entities are working effectively together and for the benefit of society,” the court said. Agius was fined €7,000 and acquitted of the other charges. The Cefais were acquitted of all the charges. Magistrate Claire Stafrace Zammit presided. Police superintendent Hubert Cini and inspector Joseph Mercieca prosecuted. Lawyers Veronique Dalli, Edward Gatt and Pio Valletta appeared for the accused. Lawyer Jason Azzopard, Kris Busietta and Alessandro Farrugia appeared for Bartolo’s family. Family members disappointed and frustrated Following the court's decisions members of the victim's family expressed frustration and disappointment by the outcome.   They said the outcome was unfair and much more could have been done int he 10 years since the tragedy.",14/10/2025,2025-10-14 14:01:03.493399+00,14/10/2025 0:00,FALSE,,,,,,,
496772,Tourist cleared of injuring man in db Seabank poolside brawl,"A man was acquitted on Wednesday morning in connection with the poolside brawl at Seabank Hotel. British tourist, Liam Joseph Stacey, was charged in July accused of causing grievous bodily harm during a brawl involving a group of allegedly drunk and aggressive Maltese patrons at the hotel. During the proceedings, it had emerged that the scene unfolded after Stacey was slapped in the face by one of the Maltese men, causing him to fall over his toddler. Stacey got up and allegedly punched the man, later identified as Roderick Sciortino, in retaliation.  The only visible mark was a small bruise on the back of Sciortino’s head, which was unrelated to the brain bleed and likely sustained when he fell. A consultant neurosurgeon confirmed that scans revealed a ruptured aneurysm -  a weakened arterial wall - that was not trauma-related. “It was a purely pathological bleed, not due to an injury,” Scerri said. He added that Sciortino’s blood pressure was recorded at 200, high enough to rupture an artery, and his alcohol levels were elevated. Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech presided. The prosecution was led by AG lawyer Brandon Bonnici, assisted by police inspectors Bradley Grima and Clayton Camilleri. Lawyer Stefano Filletti assisted the accused. Lawyer Rachel Tua appeared for Sciortino’s family. More to follow",15/10/2025,2025-10-15 08:09:43.969247+00,15/10/2025 0:00,FALSE,,,,,,,

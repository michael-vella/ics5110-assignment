article_3220.0,Danish father is finally told driver will be charged over son’s death,"The driver who hit and killed a tourist in St Julian’s more than a year ago will be charged in court, just weeks after the Danish father spoke out publicly about authorities failing to update him about the case. Asger Emil Neidhardt, a 25-year-old IT entrepreneur, died on October 28, 2023, after he was hit by a Honda Accord driven by a 44-year-old man at the entrance of the Regional Road tunnels. His father, Lars Neidhardt, contacted Times of Malta three weeks ago to express his frustration after his requests for information about the fatal accident went ignored by the Maltese authorities. He described how he was stonewalled by the police and the attorney general as he tried to get information on the progress of any investigation into the death. The Maltese police informed Neidhardt last Friday that the magisterial inquiry into his son’s death had been concluded and that the driver would be charged in court. “I am glad that we finally received some information about what happened,” Neidhardt told Times of Malta. He said it might be a “strange coincidence” how the police reached out to him following a push by Times of Malta and the Danish media outlet TV2, yet, is relieved he finally received information. “This is the first proper and real information we received from Malta about my son,” he said. An e-mail sent by a member of the police victim support unit gives details on how investigations were concluded “some weeks ago” and the inquiry report by the magistrate had also been concluded.  “The driver of the vehicle was detained on site and tested negative for alcohol,” the e-mail reads. The e-mail states that charges against the driver have been issued and the police are awaiting a date for the first court hearing. No details were provided on when the driver will be arraigned or the exact charges he will face. However, Neidhardt has been assured he will be kept informed as next of kin. In a reply to questions, a police spokesperson confirmed police investigations and the magisterial inquiry have been concluded. While Neidhardt said recounting the death of his son was “very hard”, he was pleased he did, as it finally gave him answers.  “Going over all the e-mails from the attorney general, looking up pictures of Asger and having to recount his death has been very hard,” he said. “Reliving the past was difficult but I am glad I did it and finally received some information.”",2025-02-04,2023-10-22 22:00:00,regional road,st julians,Fatal,25,M,1.0,Pedestrian,not injured,44,M,0.0,Car,,,,,,,,,,,20231022,Fatal,1.0,suspect

article_4007.0,TM suspends permits of contractor responsible for skip involved in fatal crash,"Transport Malta has suspended future permits for the contractor responsible for a skip left on the St Paul’s Bay bypass that was hit by a motorcyclist in a fatal accident last week. In a statement on Monday evening, TM said it had “suspended any future permits for this contractor until all safety standards are assured,” while confirming the contractor had “illegally” resumed works last week without a valid permit or informing the agency. “These works had been stopped for months, and any resumption without proper authorisation is entirely the responsibility of the contractor,” it said. Dieter Vink, 54, was riding a Honda motorcycle on Wednesday evening when he smashed into the stationery garbage skip placed on the bypass' final curve leading to the Xemxija roundabout. The collision left Vink in a critical condition and he was taken to Mater Dei Hospital for treatment, there succumbing to his injuries on Friday night. Footage of the incident generated an outpouring of grief and anger, with many calling for accountability over what they claimed as negligence on the part of the contractor. Times of Malta has been informed by multiple sources that the contractor in question is JV Infrastructure. Repeated attempts to contact the company were unsuccessful. Vink’s family have said they “want justice, and we will not let him pass in vain,” and have demanded accountability for the events that led to the popular hairdresser’s death. Speaking to Times of Malta less than 24 hours after his death, the family said Vink had suffered catastrophic brain trauma in the accident, with other injuries including a broken right arm, several fractured ribs, a punctured liver and spleen, two black eyes and cuts and bruises all over his body. Fleur Marie Cilia Buckett said the crash helmet the motorcyclist was wearing at the time of the crash looked like “corn flakes,” while stressing Vink was a careful rider. “That could have easily been any of us,” she said. The skip left on the road earlier that day is believed to have been placed there while JV Infrastructure was carrying out works on a boundary wall in the area.  St Paul's Bay mayor Censu Galea said the skip had also been placed on the road a few months before the fatal incident and that residents nearby had complained at the time about it being a danger.",2024-12-16,2024-12-11 17:00:00,st pauls bay bypass,st. pauls bay,Fatal,54,M,1.0,Motorbike,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20241211,Fatal,1.0,suspect

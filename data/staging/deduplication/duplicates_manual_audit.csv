article_496206.0,Watch: Traffic accident caught live on air during live Transport Malta interview,"Maltaâ€™s traffic woes were brought home to TV viewers live on air after a minor accident was caught on camera during a roadside TVM interview with a Transport Malta official. The footage shows a silver vehicle crashing into the back of a red car in front as the latter stops at a Paola roundabout, as Transport Maltaâ€™s (TM) deputy head of enforcement Jean Claude Attard is interviewed in the foreground live onÂ TVM. Attard appears startled at the sound of the accident before looking around to the scene of the bumper-to-bumper in the background, while the presenter continues speaking. The accident occurred just moments after the presenter said the pair were â€œhere in the early hours of the morning, when traffic seems to be at its peak â€“ which is normal for the countryâ€.  Reacting to the incident, Attard tells the presenter: â€œAs you can see, these things happen on the go, as behind us, we have a bumper-to-bumper which can take a while to clear the vehicles from the streetâ€. He added that TM officials would â€œplace markers on the ground of where the crash happened to move the cars as fast as possibleâ€ in addition to their duties directing traffic at what he described as â€œone of the busiest junctions in the southâ€. TM officials can be seen attending the scene shortly after the incident occurs. Thursdayâ€™s on-air accident comes as Malta continues to battle perennial congestion and frustration on the roads. On Tuesday, gridlock was particularly bad across the country as Malta registered 23 collisions, 10 vehicle breakdowns and two separate spillages across the island during morning rush hour. Motorists reported spending more than double the usual time on their commutes, and many took to social media to express frustration, complaining about standstill traffic that stretched even onto non-arterial roads. The issue spilt over into parliamentary proceedings later that day when Opposition Leader Alex Borg quipped to Robert Abela that he was delayed because, due to not being escorted like the prime minister, he was stuck in traffic.",09/10/2025,09/10/2025 00:00,paola roundabout,paola,slight,none,none,0,Car,slight,none,none,0,Car,,,,,,,,,,,20251009,,0,retain,paola,paola roundabout,

In a statement, the council said, â€œsome weeks ago, one of the arches of the historic aqueduct located in our locality collapsed due to a traffic accident that occurred in the areaâ€. While no further details about the accident were provided, in July part of the historic Wignacourt aqueduct in MrieÄ§el was closed off for checks after a truck hit one of the arches as it joined the Rabat road. An architect was appointed by the Superintendence of Cultural Heritage to evaluate and prepare a report on the damage, with repair works to be carried out â€œby the relevant authoritiesâ€, the council said.Â  â€œThe council wishes to emphasise that it is not within its remit to carry out these works, nor does it hold any legal or technical responsibility for the repair of the archâ€, it said. â€œNevertheless, the council has been actively and continuously putting pressure and engaging to ensure that these works are undertaken as soon as possible.â€ The council said the pending repairs were â€œparticularly importantâ€ due to the new school year starting later this month, with it â€œvery aware of the traffic pressure that already exists in the area â€“ pressure that has increased due to the closure of this archâ€. It â€œstrongly appealedâ€ to authorities ""to make every effort to ensure that the necessary works are carried out without further delay"". The Birkirkara community and residents â€œdeserve a serious and immediate solution to this inconvenience that has persisted for too longâ€, the council said. The aqueduct was built on the orders of Grand Master Wignacourt, for whom it is named, to carry water from springs in Dingli and Rabat to Valletta. It was inaugurated in April 1615. This is not the first time the historic structure was damaged; in August 2018, one of the arches was damaged when the driver of a large concrete-mix truck ignored traffic signs and tried to drive through, damaging the central corbel stone of the arch. The council statement was signed by mayor Desirei Grech and executive secretary Christine-Jo Mansueto.",09/09/2025,09/09/2025 00:00,wignacourt aqueduct,birkirkara,not injured,none,none,none,van,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20250909,not injured,0,retain,birkirkara,wignacourt aqueduct,

This country should act to reduce preventable injuries and deaths,â€ Spiteri said. In a number of proposals to address the issue, the Opposition insisted on â€œzero toleranceâ€ for accidents caused by drivers who are found to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, stronger law enforcement, harsher penalties and the introduction of a â€œnew specific criminal offenceâ€ for causing death or grievous bodily harm due to gross negligence, recklessness and/or dangerous driving. This offence would carry a minimum penalty of five yearsâ€™ effective imprisonment, rising up to life imprisonment in cases with aggravating factors, the PN said. Currently, the Police Force has 18 breathalysers, while LESA has five breathalyser kits, all of which only detect alcohol. The PN said the number of road-testing devices â€œmust be increasedâ€ and kits that detect drugs should be added. â€œThis is a real and serious problem on our roads,â€ the PN said. They also highlighted the shortage of staff allocated in the police traffic section and urged for greater investment in the police force, the traffic section and the authorities responsible for road enforcement. These proposals follow a chorus of voices from various entities calling for the introduction of random drug and alcohol tests for motorists and increased road safety.",21/08/2025,21/08/2025 06:00,tower road,sliema,not injured,none,M,0,Car,not injured,none,none,0,Bus,,,,,,,,,,,20250821,not injured,0,retain,sliema,tower road,

article_490697.0,"Magistrate urges random alcohol, drug tests after fatal biker crash","A magistrate has called for random roadside alcohol and drug testing of drivers, after a fatal Senglea motorcycle crash revealed the rider had cocaine in his system. Magistrate Joe Mifsud made the recommendation following a magisterial inquiry into the June accident on Triq ix-Xatt Juan B. Azopardo. The 43-year-old motorcyclist lost control, struck a bollard and was killed on the spot. No one else was injured. Toxicology tests conducted during the autopsy found traces of cocaine in his system. In his concluding remarks, Mifsud said that â€œwhile it seems that disciplinary measures have started being taken while driving, enforcement needs to increase and officials should be conscious of their role in protecting livesâ€. He stressed that while discipline has never killed anyone, substance abuse has, with the victims sometimes being innocent, law-abiding citizens who suffer due to the abuse of others. The magistrate urged better coordination between the authorities and constant, rather than sporadic, law enforcement presence on the roads. He referred to a 2023 position paper co-written by NGO Doctors For Road Safety, the Maltese Association of Psychiatry and the Foundation for Welfare Services on drug-driving under the influence of psychoactive drugs.  The paper states that â€œthe use of psychoactive drugs can result in impaired driving skills, leading to an increased risk of road traffic crashes. â€œIt is important to note that the most common psychoactive drugs involved in driving crashes are often taken for recreational purposes, although prescription drugs such as benzodiazepines and opioids can also impair driving skills.â€ Mifsud endorsed each of the paperâ€™s eight recommendations, including the introduction of a legal framework to enable random drug testing for psychoactive substances, as well as the random screening of professional drivers, such as taxi, school bus, coach and heavy machinery drivers. The paper also called for the establishment of clear guidelines regarding acceptable substance levels in the body while driving, and the review and updating of existing legislation to include penalties for the combined use of drugs and alcohol to reflect the increased risk to road safety. Many European countries allow random or targeted random roadside testing for alcohol or drugs. In the UK, Germany and Malta, the police need â€œreasonable suspicionâ€ to conduct tests. The Maltese magistrateâ€™s call comes amid a spate of serious road accidents in recent weeks, several linked to drink-driving. In July, AFM soldier Benjamin Chetcuti was allegedly five times over the alcohol limit when his car hit 62-year-old Mildred Azzopardi in Valletta, killing her and injuring her husband. The test returned a positive result of 139.2 Î¼g/100ml when the legal limit is 22micrograms. On August 10, food courier Khim Bahadur Pun, 42, from Nepal, was killed when his motorcycle was hit by a car driven by a 17-year-old in Santa Venera. The youth fled the scene but was arrested five hours later. Police said a breathalyser test found he was over the legal alcohol limit. And earlier this month, a taxi crashed into a hair salon in Santa Venera. The owner, who was outside at the time, was unhurt. Tests showed the driverâ€™s alcohol level exceeded 100mg.",18/08/2025,18/08/2025 00:00,triq ix-xatt juan b. azopardo,senglea,Fatal,43,none,0,Motorbike,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20250818,Fatal,0,retain,cospicua,triq ix-xatt juan b azopardo,

Yoana Valentinova Gatt, a 44-year-old Bulgarian national living in St Paulâ€™s Bay, admitted earlier this week to causing grievous bodily harm through negligence to the motorcyclist, damaging the victimâ€™s motorcycle, driving under the influence and drink driving.

Eyewitnesses who testified earlier this week explained how five men had lifted the womanâ€™s car, which had its engine still running, to free the trapped motorcyclist. The motorcyclist was placed in the recovery position until the emergency services arrived at the scene. A breathalyser test revealed Valentinova Gatt was six times over the legal limit, with the test marking 124.9 Î¼g/100ml (microgrammes of alcohol per 100ml breath).

article_490746.0,"Drunk cab driver was waiting for passengers before crash into salon, court hears","A cab driver who was over the legal alcohol limit when he crashed into a Santa Venera hair salon told police he had been waiting for passengers, a court has heard. Abdi Salaan Mahamad Abditon Ali had a reading of 107.3 micrograms of alcohol per 100 ml breath, when the legal limit for cab drivers is zero, after the crash into Maricaâ€™s Salon, on Cannon Road, on August 7. A court on Monday heard that he gave a statement to police, in which he said he was waiting for passengers just before the collision. ""Thank God no one requested a cabâ€¦ It could have resulted in fatalities,â€ police inspector Nathan Bugeja told the court.Â   The 42-year-old Somali national stands accused of driving in a negligent, dangerous and reckless manner, causing damage to third property, and driving under influence. He denies the charges. The salon was still closed at the time of the incident and there were no injuries. A police constable testified about receiving a call regarding the collision, with the initial information stating that the vehicle had crashed into a â€œhouseâ€. When the witness got onsite, he found the owner, Marica Baldacchino, who had not seen the incident. The witness went to Mater Dei Hospital where he spoke to the driver. He returned back when another constable was subjecting the driver to the a breathalyzer test. The constable underlined that a cab driverâ€™s limit is 0 Î¼g/100ml. During Mondayâ€™s sitting, the prosecution and defence made submissions on bail. Police inspector Bugeja objected due to the seriousness of the crime.Â  Bugeja also highlighted that although the manâ€™s address on his official documents and the charge sheet state that he lives in St Paulâ€™s Bay, the police accompanied him to a Ä¦amrun address to collect his passport. Defence lawyer Francesca Zarb counter-argued that the defendant has been in Malta since 2008 and this was his first brush with the law. He was granted subsidiary protection and has a residence permit. The lawyer observed that the court as presided hears cases on traffic collisions and argued that individuals with the same charges are brought before it under summons not under arrest. Zarb also argued that whether the man is granted bail or otherwise, the amount of damages would not be affected. Bugeja rebutted the argument stating that usually collisions do not involve third parties, nor do they involve damages running into thousands of euros. While an exact figure was not given during Mondayâ€™s sitting, the damages sustained are between â‚¬10,000 to â‚¬15,000. These will be confirmed once the salon owner takes the stand. The police inspector also added that the man poses a risk to the public. Zarb observed that two of Aliâ€™s friends were present in the courtroom, with one of them willing to host him. The friend told the court that he came to Malta in 2006 and has known the accused for the past eight years. The court then asked the accused whether he held a bank account, signalling it was willing to grant bail, only if a bank guarantee could be made. After establishing that Ali lacked a bank account with a local bank through which he could guarantee at least â‚¬10,000 in favour of the victim, the court denied the man bail. In its decision, the court held that it does not have the peace of mind he would be able to satisfy all conditions otherwise imposed by the court in a bail decree, even though at this stage, the man is presumed innocent until proven guilty. The case continues later this month. Magistrate Victor Axiak presided.Police inspectors Nathan Bugeja and Rachel Aquilina prosecuted.Lawyer Francesca Zarb appeared for the accused.Lawyers Zack Esmail and Kaylie Borg appeared parte civile.",18/08/2025,07/08/2025 08:00,cannon road,santa venera,not injured,42,M,0,car,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20250807,not injured,0,delete,santa venera,cannon road,article_489733.0

The test returned a reading of 139.2 Î¼g/100ml (microgrammes of alcohol per 100 ml) of breath or about five times the legal limit, Superintendent Nicholas Vella said at the compilation of evidence against Chetcuti, an AFM soldier arraigned last month. He stands accused of the involuntary homicide of Mildred Azzopardi, driving under the influence and grievously injuring Azzopardi's husband through negligence. He denies the charges. Mildred Azzopardi, 62, from Ä¦amrun, a mother of four, died at the scene on July 27 when Chetcuti's car ploughed into her car as she put items in the boot. The 23-year-old accused joined the AFM as a recruit in January and on June 10 had his passing out ceremony and was confirmed as a gunner. He was posted to the Maritime Squadron on July 1. Police superintendent Nicholas Vella from the Road Policing Unit testified on how the accident happened at Xatt il-Barrieri, where the Azzopardis had earlier been fishing. Vella played out footage from ten CCTV cameras, explaining that the accused drove around Fort St Elmo initially at 36km/hr. His Subaru Impresa could then be seen at a speed of 246.33/m in nine seconds, meaning an average speed of 98 km/hr. The superintendent said Alfred Azzopardi, the victim's husband, was already in their Ford Fiesta while Mildred was putting some stuff away in the boot when the crash took place. CCTV footage taken from the offices of shipping companies in the area showed the Subaru Impresa arriving at a high speed before the driver lost control and it swerved, hitting Mildred Azzopardi' car first. Azzopardi died on the spot.  Medicolegal expert Mario Scerri testified that Mildred Azzopardi sustained several bone fractures and internal haemorrhage. Her husband sufferedÂ  grievous injuries and was in intensive care for a while. He added that Chetcuti tested negative for drugs. His urine sample was sent to another expert for further testing. Medicolegal experts Ali Sarfraz and David Pisani took the witness stand and testified jointly on the findings of the post-mortem examination which showed that Mildred Azzopardi suffered multiple injuries. An eyewitness also took the stand on Tuesday morning. Reeves Cini explained that at the time of the incident he was at the nearby Siege Bell Memorial. â€œWhen I arrived on site I found Benjamin,â€ the witness said, clarifying that he knew the accused from the time the latter worked in Valletta. The road had already been closed. The witness said he feared the worst since his grandfather owned a boathouse in the area. He asked Chectuti if he wanted something to drink, and ran up to his home and got him a soft drink from the fridge.

Tonamol Baby, 28, was five months pregnant when she was struck by a car while crossing the road to start her shift as a nurse at Mount Carmel Hospital on July 16. She lost her baby and has been in hospital ever since, while her 34-year-old husband Tom Jacob spends his days by her side, far from their home in Kerala, India. Tom turned to Times of Malta to share the coupleâ€™s story as he set up a crowdfunding campaign for an air ambulance to take her home.  The cost of the medical flight is around â‚¬20,000 and the hospital costs would be at leastÂ another â‚¬30,000.Â  Tom daily arrives at the neurosurgical ward at Mater Dei Hospital at 8am to sit by the bedside of his wife of three years, staying until he leaves for work at 6pm. He is employed as a sommelier with the db Group. He thanked everyone who contributed, including the db Group and â€œthe db familyâ€, the Healthmark team (Tonaâ€™s employers), the Kerala federations and Tonamolâ€™s friends. â€œWords cannot fully express our gratitude.

article_297729.0,Rider injured in hit-and-run is told tunnel cameras donâ€™t work,"A scooter rider injured in a hit-and-run crash in the Regional Road tunnels earlier this month is struggling to track down the driver, after being told that none of the tunnel cameras work. Giuseppe Di Dio, a 22-year-old Sicilian who works as a DJ and event organiser, was riding his Vespa 300 on July 2 at around 12.30pm when he was hit. As he entered the tunnel heading towards Swieqi, he says a van crossed into his lane, cut him off and crashed into him, knocking him off his Vespa. â€œI feel super lucky to tell the story. It hurt a lot. When I was on the floor, I could feel my burns,â€ he told Times of Malta. Shocked by the impact, Di Dio said he could not identify the van but recalled opening his eyes to see the driver standing over him. According to Di Dio, the man looked South Asian and was wearing a blue shirt. He believes he was driving a delivery van but is unsure which company the van belonged to. â€œHe came over, checked I was alive, told me nothing and rushed off,â€ he said. â€œI know if I saw him, I would recognise him.â€ Thankfully, other drivers stopped to help Di Dio. He was taken to Mater Dei Hospital, where he said he had to wait between six to seven hours before being seen. â€œThat was horrible. I couldnâ€™t take it anymore and began to scream out in pain, and only then did they see me,â€ he said. He was initially told he had minor injuries and was prescribed painkillers. But after several days, his wounds became increasingly painful and doctors at Saint James Hospital later confirmed they were infected. Alongside the physical injuries, Di Dio said his motorbike was damaged and he incurred around â‚¬4,000 in expenses for medical treatment, medications, transport and missed work. â€œI want a refund for the damages but the most important thing is I want to find out who hit me to avoid future accidents,â€ he said.  After being treated, Di Dio filed a police report. He hoped CCTV footage from the tunnel would help identify the van. But he said police informed him that the security cameras inside the Taâ€™ Giorni tunnels do not work. â€œItâ€™s insane. The policeman told me that none of the cameras they have for the tunnels work,â€ he said. â€œI told them that it is impossible but they told me again that none of them work.â€ In 2020, the government launched a â‚¬10 million project to upgrade Maltaâ€™s major tunnels, including Taâ€™ Giorni, which included the installation of security cameras.

article_894.0,"Share first, think later: When 'citizen journalism' crosses ethical lines","Photographing and sharing images of tragic accidents on social media is â€œcitizen journalism at its worstâ€ and highlights the urgent need to focus on digital education across the nation, according to experts in communication and human behaviour. The issue came to light once again following a recent fatal traffic accident in which a motorcyclist died on the spot. After the accident, graphic photos were shared extensively via WhatsApp. This had also happened some months ago when footage of another fatal accident, that involved a car losing control, made the rounds on social media. Prof. Anton Grech, clinical chairman of Mental Health Services, explained that while human curiosity in the case of unusual or dramatic situations is normal â€“ a phenomenon known as rubbernecking â€“ social media amplified this. These actions â€“ of taking and sharing images of tragic situations â€“ were a reflection of a larger situation, he said. Before social media existed there were â€˜celebritiesâ€™ and â€˜spectatorsâ€™. Social media brought with it a shift in which many people wanted to be protagonists. This was happening in a virtual environment that is saturated with content and, in which, in order to be seen and stand out, the content has to be attention-grabbing. â€œIn parallel with this, we are losing respect for the society around us. We saw this in a recent case when a man was threatening to jump off the Valletta bastions,â€ he said, referring to the 2021 case when onlookers urged a man to jump from the edge of a Valletta bastion, with many filming the ordeal. â€œMany people seize all opportunities to gain this recognition without respect for others,â€ he said, adding that there was an urgent need to educate people on this matter. Prof. Brenda Murphy, a media and gender expert and founder of NGO Mediating Women, agreed that there was the urgent need for more media education â€“ in schools and beyond â€“ through curriculum and public campaigns. â€œThis is a public education issue â€“ we need to re-establish digital boundaries. We need to remind people that our duty of care doesnâ€™t disappear when we are online,â€ she said. Such cases, she said, were â€œcitizen journalism at its worstâ€ as they offered â€œa great snapshot of the widening gaps in â€˜news productionâ€™â€. â€œJournalists and editors are trained, educated, bound by professional regulation â€“ citizens operate withoutÂ any of these guardrails. While citizen journalism was lauded as a great liberator for information â€“ this is an example of a great backfire,â€ she said. A deeply problematic phenomenon Murphy explained that the sharing of such images was a â€œdeeply problematic phenomenonâ€ that reflects multiple pressures converging at the moment. From a digital culture perspective, she said, we are living in a world where everything is documented, and the boundary between private and public is becoming increasingly eroded. â€œIn the case of tragic moments, there seems to be an underlying belief that if something shocking happens, it should be recorded and shared. The algorithms that drive social media amplify this. They reward visibility, and sadly that includes tragic events,â€ she said. Then there was the conversation on media ethics. Â â€œWe may have the capacity to capture something digitally, but that doesnâ€™t mean we should. Sharing media content has become so normalised it completely breaches the private-public boundary. We need to be mindful that sharing a traumatic event compounds trauma â€“ not just for the family and friends but the wider community is impacted too. We cannot justify this â€˜norm driftâ€™ by saying â€˜itâ€™s already out there, so itâ€™s ok to repostâ€™,â€ she said.",29/05/2025,27/05/2025 12:30,xemxija bypass,xemxija,Fatal,35,M,1,Motorbike,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20250527,Fatal,1,retain,xemxija,xemxija bypass,

The accident happened on Triq Buqana in Rabat at around 10am. The spillage caused both carriageways of the main road leading to MÄ¡arr to be closed to traffic. The driver of the DAC truck - a 35-year-old man from Marsascala - was taken to hospital by ambulance.Â  In a Facebook post, Transport Malta announced it had closed the road in both directions until the vehicle and the sand were cleared away.  ROTA urges segregation of high-speed traffic, bicyclesÂ  In a statement on Friday afternoon, bicycle advocacy group ROTA said the crash flagged the urgent need forÂ better road safety measures, particularly for bicycle users. The truck, the NGO said, ended up within the bicycle lane, where, had there been a bicycle user, they could have been fatally injured. ""The current road design offers no protection for cyclists, and this tragic event highlights the pressing need for proper segregation between high-speed traffic and vulnerable road users, particularly those on bicycles,"" ROTA said. The need for protected bicycle lanes is not just a local issue - the matter has also been flagged in international road safety guidelines such as the CROW guidelines. These guidelines emphasise the importance of segregation in high-speed areas and the need for roads that are forgiving of human error, the group noted. ""In simple terms, we must ensure that the consequences of mistakes â€“ whether made by a driver or a cyclist â€“ are not fatal. Sadly, Malta is still without a legally binding national cycling policy that will outline clear standards for the design and implementation of safe and effective bicycle lanes. ""We cannot allow cyclists to be subjected to what is, at best, a makeshift effort that often amounts to nothing more than a splash of green paint and some rumble strips. It is not enough. Bicycle lanes need to be designed to protect cyclists â€“ physically separated from traffic in high-speed areas, with sufficient space and barriers to prevent accidents.""",14/03/2025,14/03/2025 10:00,triq buqana,rabat,Grievious,35,M,1,Van,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20250314,Grievious,1,retain,rabat,triq buqana,

Andre Spiteri suffered broken ribs, punctured lungs, a broken wrist and a dislocated shoulder when his motorcycle was hit by a van shortly after 11pm on Monday night. The crash happened on Triq il-Kappillan Mifsud, police said. The 23-year-old is recovering from his ordeal at Mater Dei hospital but the driver who fled the scene remains at large. Appealing for information, the Tarxien Rainbows goalkeeper said he doesnâ€™t know how he survived the crash.  Spiteri next remembers lying down on the ground and struggling to breathe. â€œI couldnâ€™t breathe, it was like someone was trying to choke me, and the pain started immediately,â€ he said. â€œI could see that my wrist was broken, and I tried to lift my head and the visor slightly, but I didnâ€™t remove my helmet.â€ He recalled how a Syrian man rushed to his side and held his hand, while a woman who lives close by and heard the accident also stayed by his side. â€œThey both never left my side, and the woman stayed asking me questions to see what I remembered and how I was feeling,â€ he said. His parents and girlfriend were in shock when they learned about the accident and are determined to get justice for him. From debris left on the scene, the van appears to be a Citroen Berlingo. The police and paramedics arrived shortly afterwards, and he was taken straight to hospital, where he still is recovering days later. Spiteri says he is thankful that his girlfriend was not with him at the time. â€œEight minutes after I dropped her home, the accident happened,â€ he said. â€œMy life has changed completely right now. I cannot work or practise football now, I need time to recover.â€ A police spokesperson said investigations are ongoing.",27/02/2025,24/02/2025 23:45,triq il-kappillan mifsud,hamrun,Serious,23,M,1,Motorbike,not injured,Unknown,Unknown,0,van,,,,,,,,,,,20250224,Serious,1,retain,hamrun,triq il-kappilan mifsud,

article_4024.0,â€˜Iâ€™m tired of going to friendsâ€™ funeralsâ€™: bikers' anger after skip crash death,"The president of a motorcycle advocacy group has expressed his anger at the perceived negligence of the authorities, which he says led to the death of a biker last week. Dieter Vink, 54, died last Friday, two days after crashing his motorcycle into a skip positioned on the final curve of the St Paulâ€™s Bay bypass before the Xemxija roundabout.  â€œIâ€™m sick of going to funerals. It feels like our lives are cheap,â€ Galea said, mentioning the deaths of Johanna Boni, after being hit by a truck in 2015, and Marie Claire Lombardi, who lost control of her bike after it skidded on olives spilled onto the road in 2022. Speaking about the experience of riding a motorcycle more generally, Galea said it had become more dangerous to drive on Maltaâ€™s roads over the past four or five years. â€œI think itâ€™s because drivers are frustrated by the ever-increasing traffic, which in turn leads them to drive in an impatient and careless manner. Right now, the situation feels like itâ€™s beyond repair,â€ he said. Aldo Overend, a committee member of the NGO, echoed Galeaâ€™s sentiments.Â  â€œWe just hope this accident will lead to action because we canâ€™t go on like this,"" he said. ""While riding, I feel like I constantly have to dodge heavy vehicles, construction materials, fresh concrete and water leaking from bowsers, as well as reckless car drivers not taking us into account."" Official data shows almost 40 per cent of all road traffic casualties involve motorcyclists.Â  Vinkâ€™s family and friends have vowed to get justice for his death and are seeking legal advice. A GoFundMe page has been set up to raise funds to cover funeral and legal expenses, along with a fundraising bike ride planned for December 28, starting at Mater Dei Hospital and ending at Vinkâ€™s second home, The Pitstop in Xemxija.",17/12/2024,11/12/2024 17:00,st pauls bay bypass,st pauls bay,Fatal,54,M,1,Motorbike,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20241211,Fatal,1,retain,san pawl il bahar,xemxija bypass,
article_4007.0,TM suspends permits of contractor responsible for skip involved in fatal crash,"Transport Malta has suspended future permits for the contractor responsible for a skip left on the St Paulâ€™s Bay bypass that was hit by a motorcyclist in a fatal accident last week. In a statement on Monday evening, TM said it had â€œsuspended any future permits for this contractor until all safety standards are assured,â€ while confirming the contractor had â€œillegallyâ€ resumed works last week without a valid permit or informing the agency. â€œThese works had been stopped for months, and any resumption without proper authorisation is entirely the responsibility of the contractor,â€ it said. Dieter Vink, 54, was riding a Honda motorcycle on Wednesday evening when he smashed into the stationery garbage skip placed on the bypass' final curve leading to the Xemxija roundabout. The collision left Vink in a critical condition and he was taken to Mater Dei Hospital for treatment, there succumbing to his injuries on Friday night. Footage of the incident generated an outpouring of grief and anger, with many calling for accountability over what they claimed as negligence on the part of the contractor. Times of Malta has been informed by multiple sources that the contractor in question is JV Infrastructure. Repeated attempts to contact the company were unsuccessful. Vinkâ€™s family have said they â€œwant justice, and we will not let him pass in vain,â€ and have demanded accountability for the events that led to the popular hairdresserâ€™s death. Speaking to Times of Malta less than 24 hours after his death, the family said Vink had suffered catastrophic brain trauma in the accident, with other injuries including a broken right arm, several fractured ribs, a punctured liver and spleen, two black eyes and cuts and bruises all over his body. Fleur Marie Cilia Buckett said the crash helmet the motorcyclist was wearing at the time of the crash looked like â€œcorn flakes,â€ while stressing Vink was a careful rider. â€œThat could have easily been any of us,â€ she said. The skip left on the road earlier that day is believed to have been placed there while JV Infrastructure was carrying out works on a boundary wall in the area. Â St Paul's Bay mayor Censu Galea said the skip had also been placed on the road a few months before the fatal incident and that residents nearby had complained at the time about it being a danger.",16/12/2024,11/12/2024 17:00,st pauls bay bypass,st. pauls bay,Fatal,54,M,1,Motorbike,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20241211,Fatal,1,delete,san pawl il bahar,xemxija bypass,article_4024.0
article_2975.0,â€˜We are utterly disgusted. But this is Maltaâ€™: crash victim parents in the dark,"The parents of a motorcyclist killed in a horror crash with an unpermitted skip say they have been left in the dark, with the authorities failing to provide updates or press charges two months later.Â  Anthony Holmes, 80, and his wife, Patricia, 79, spoke to Times of Malta from the home of their late son, Dieter Vink, where they were still sorting their sonâ€™s belongings. â€œNo one has been in touch at all,â€ said Vinkâ€™s mother, noting there had been complete silence from the authorities since her husband and their sonâ€™s close friend, Juliette Johnson, collected his personal items. â€œWe are extremely disappointed that things havenâ€™t moved on,â€ she added.Â  Anthony Holmes went further: â€œIt is more than disappointing. We are utterly disgusted. But I learnt this is Malta.â€ , police would have been on this like white on rice and probably would have charged whoever is responsible by now,â€ said Vinkâ€™s father.Â  The couple, originally from Yorkshire, England, said that such obstacles in a UK street would have seen half a mile of cones and warning lights to divertÂ traffic.Â  â€œThere was nothing for our son to see. It is too relaxed in Malta, and it feels like health and safety doesnâ€™t exist here,â€ he added. Footage of the crashâ€™s aftermath sparked widespread anger on social media, with many calling for accountability, citing alleged negligence by the contractor. Multiple sources informed Times of Malta that JV Infrastructure was responsible for the skip, but repeated attempts to contact the company were unsuccessful. 'I donâ€™t even want to get out of bed' A magisterial inquiry is ongoing, but the lack of communication and updates has deeply affected Vinkâ€™s family and friends.Â  Clutching a locket containing a strand of her sonâ€™s hair, his mother admitted: â€œI donâ€™t even want to get out of bed most days anymore.â€ She recalled her fond memories of Malta, where she lived as a child while her father worked with the Royal Air Force. For decades, the couple had vacationed here yearly, often staying up to 90 days post-Brexit. What was once a â€œhome away from homeâ€ has changed forever.Â  â€œAt first, I swore I would never return, but his ashes are here, and I want to maintain a connection to him in some way,â€ Patricia Holmes said.Â  As they prepare to return to the UK, Vinkâ€™s parents are already planning their return in a few months for a vigil in their sonâ€™s honour and hope to plant freesias in the small park near his home. â€œLike that, we can sit and talk to him,â€ his mother said.Â For now, they believe these small acts offer a semblance of closure. But, they stress, it is far from enough and demand justice for their son.",16/02/2025,11/12/2024 17:00,st pauls bay bypass,st pauls bay,Fatal,54,M,1,Motorbike,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20241211,Fatal,1,delete,san pawl il bahar,xemxija bypass,article_4024.0
article_4067.0,"Tributes, anger flow for motorcyclist killed after slamming into a skip","Dieter Vink was a true gentleman, said friends of the 54-year-old British motorcyclist, who died on Friday night, two days after crashing into a skip placed on a curve of the bypass leading to Xemxija. Friends and acquaintances have remembered Vink as a warm and principled man who left an indelible mark on their lives but there is palpable anger over whether the tragedy could have been prevented.Â  Fleur Marie Cilia Buckett, who had been friends with Vink for 17 years, described the victim as ""an amazing man"" who stood by her in her darkest hours. In return, she stayed by his side in the hours following his tragic crash. â€œHe was a man full of morals, good Yorkshire stock, and an animal lover to his core,â€ she said. Buckett recalled how they met on the social platform Hi5, where Vink adopted his beloved cats, Xemx and Bomba, who are now in need of a new home. Buckett expressed her devastation upon learning of his accident from a Times of Malta online report. â€œMy heart stopped, and I howled in disbelief. He was so careful - that could have easily been any of us.â€ Determined to honour her friendâ€™s memory, Buckett is organising a bike ride in his name on December 28, starting at Mater Dei Hospital and ending at Xemxija Pitstop, where donations will be collected to help pay for his cremation and lawyers' fees. They will also set up a GoFundMe page for the above.Â  â€œI can assure you I will fight tooth and nail till justice is served,â€ she added.  Dorian Sid Turner, a fellow motorcyclist and a friend of Vink for 10 years, echoed these sentiments. â€œThe world lost a true gentleman,â€ he said, reminiscing about how Vink, a freelance hairdresser, would cut his and his sonâ€™s hair. â€œHe was such a good listener. Even if I was having a bad day, somehow he could make me smile,â€ Turner added. Speaking on behalf of the biking community, he vowed that Vinkâ€™s death would not be in vain. â€œWe will not rest until justice is served,â€ Turner said. Vink, who lived in Malta since the 1990s, originally hailed from Yorkshire, England. After training as a hairdresser, he later became a customer service specialist. For the past five years, he was a familiar face at the Xemxija Pitstop, where owner Vickie Cutajar described him as â€œa true gentlemanâ€ and â€œa very good client.â€ â€œDieter was warm and friendly,â€ Cutajar said, adding that customers recognised him immediately from news reporting the accident because of his motorcycle. She shared how Vink would often stop by on his way to work for his usual Americano and toast, a routine the staff will deeply miss. The police confirmed that Vink was riding his Honda motorcycle on Wednesday evening when he collided with the skip. Although emergency responders took him to Mater Dei Hospital, he succumbed to his injuries on Friday. Transport Malta, Infrastructure Malta, and the St Paulâ€™s Bay local council have denied issuing any permit for the skip to be placed in the busy thoroughfare. The skip is believed to have been placed by a contractor working on a boundary wall. St Paulâ€™s Bay mayor Censu Galea said that residents had previously raised safety concerns about the skip, which had been placed at the same location months earlier.",14/12/2024,11/12/2024 17:00,st pauls bay bypass,st paul's bay,Fatal,54,M,1,Motorbike,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20241211,Fatal,1,delete,san pawl il bahar,xemxija bypass,article_4024.0

Police and emergency responders rushed to the scene and took him to Mater Dei Hospital for treatment.

article_4110.0,Skip involved in horror St Paulâ€™s Bay bypass crash 'did not have permit',"A private contractor who placed a skip on St Paul's Bay bypass that was involved in a serious road accident on Wednesday did not have a permit, local authorities say.Â  The mayor of St Paulâ€™s Bay, Infrastructure Malta, and Transport Malta all said they did not grant permission for the unnamed contractor to place a skip on the road on Wednesday.Â  A 54-year-old motorcyclist was seriously injured when he crashed into the stationary garbage skip left on a blind bend along the bypass.  Transport Malta said it ""was not informed about the works, and the contractor did not hold a valid permit to carry out works at the site where the accident occurred.""Â  Similarly, Infrastructure Malta said it ""had not been notified about the works, and no permission was requested for them."" However, it acknowledged that the accident occurred near works being carried out by a private contractor under its administration. It did not name the contractor involved. In October, Infrastructure Malta began work to replace a dangerous leaning wall along the same bypass section where the accident happened. St Paulâ€™s Bay Mayor, Censu Galea, also confirmed that the council had not issued any permits. ""No permits were ever issued as far as I am informed,"" he said. He said he was told the skip was placed on the road at around 1pm on Wednesday. The incident was reported to the police at around 5pm.Â  The mayor noted that the same skip had been in the same location two to three months ago, and people raised safety concerns with the council at the time. He explained that once he was informed, the council alerted Infrastructure Malta, which added cones and bollards at that time. The skip involved in Wednesdayâ€™s accident was left at the final curve leading to the Xemxija roundabout. According to the police, the injured motorcyclist, an English man from MellieÄ§a, lost control of his Honda and collided with the skip. He remains in Mater Dei Hospital with serious injuries. While traffic cones and a bollard were at the site, an eyewitness and social media users described these safety features as insufficient.",12/12/2024,11/12/2024 17:00,st pauls bay bypass,st paul's bay,Serious,54,M,1,Motorbike,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20241211,Serious,1,delete,san pawl il bahar,xemxija bypass,article_4024.0

article_4208.0,Driver stuck in traffic says speeding LESA car shattered his mirror,"A motorist claims his car mirror was shattered by a speeding LESA vehicle that failed to stop after hitting his car while he was stuck in traffic. Frank Xerri De Caro, 78, was driving his Toyota Yaris home after a meeting on Wednesday around 5pm when the accident occurred on the Regional Road, near the St Julianâ€™s tunnels. Heavy traffic had brought vehicles to a near standstill, leaving little room for manoeuvring. As he approached the tunnels next to St Clareâ€™s Convent, Xerri De Caro said he noticed what he then believed to be a police car with sirens blaring in the distance. Attempting to give way, he moved his car closer to the side of the road. â€œI could tell the car was coming quite close to me but I couldnâ€™t move anymore as I didnâ€™t have more space to,â€ he explained. Moments later, he said a speeding LESA vehicle struck his right-hand side mirror, shattering it into pieces on the ground. Xerri De Caro described feeling both shocked and frustrated, notably when the car continued without stopping to assess the situation. â€œI was shocked at that moment but more so frustrated afterwards,â€ he said, explaining that he had to spend â‚¬300 to repair the damage. Xerri De Caro, who shared his experience on social media, initially said his mirror was destroyed by a police car.Â After filing a police report and speaking with the police on Thursday morning, he noticed he made a mistake and said that it had been a LESA car that hit his mirror.Â  He took to social media once again to praise the police for their efficient work and thanked them for their assistance.Â  LESA responded to the matter in question by saying, ""LESA has received no communication regarding this matter from the injured party prior to this media question."" They continued, "" LESA invites the injured party to provide all relevant information so that the necessary checks can be made, in accordance with the usual procedure.""",07/12/2024,04/12/2024 17:00,regional road,st julian's,not injured,78,M,0,Car,not injured,Unknown,Unknown,0,Car,,,,,,,,,,,20241204,not injured,0,retain,st julian,regional road,
article_495942.0,Traffic collision case collapses over identification failure and police error,"A St Paulâ€™s Bay man accused of causing a traffic collision has been acquitted after the alleged victim failed to identify him in court and police failed to follow proper procedures during the investigation. Dennis Attard, 49, of Triq l-Imsida, Santa Venera, faced five charges stemming from a collision on 23 September 2024 in Triq Censu Tabone, St Paulâ€™s Bay, including reckless driving, causing involuntary damage, driving without a licence, driving an unlicensed vehicle, and driving without insurance. The case centred on a collision between Attardâ€™s vehicle and a motorcycle ridden by Marland Herman Jones. Jones told the court he was riding down a narrow street when a car â€œjust kind of jumped inâ€ and pulled out in front of him. â€œI braked as hard as I could but I hit the I believe his door or the front right quarter panel,â€ he testified, adding that he â€œjust kind of fell over and jumped up cursing.â€ Jones explained that the driver claimed he had to leave urgently because â€œhis daughter was giving birth.â€ They exchanged phone numbers via WhatsApp, but when Jones attempted to contact him, he received no response despite seeing the messages had been viewed. â€œI tried to contact him again, no answer. He viewed the I saw it through the messaging app. I could tell that he watched it,â€ Jones testified. However, when asked to identify the accused in court, Jones admitted: â€œActually at at this date I canâ€™t recognize him in court, if this is the gentleman, I donâ€™t quite recognize him, I have to be honest.â€ He explained he had identified someone at the police station â€œover 8 months agoâ€ but â€œcouldnâ€™t tell you now.â€ The defence suggested Jones had hit the car from behind, but Jones firmly rejected this, stating repeatedly: â€œThatâ€™d be completely incorrectâ€ and â€œThatâ€™d be incredibly incorrect.â€ Magistrate Yana Micallef Stafrace dismissed all charges on Monday, ruling that Jones â€œdid not recognise the accused in Courtâ€ and noting his claimed identification at the police station â€œdoes not result from the police affidavit.â€ Moreover, the court found that â€œon the day of the collision the right to silence was not administered to the accused as required by law.â€ Court therefore concluded that â€œthe evidence does not provide beyond reasonable doubt all the elements of the crime, and therefore the imputations have not been proven to the degree required in the criminal field.â€ Attard chose not to testify and was acquitted of all charges.",06/10/2025,23/09/2024 00:00,triq censu tabone,st pauls bay,not injured,49,M,0,Car,not injured,none,M,0,Motorbike,,,,,,,,,,,20240923,not injured,0,retain,san pawl il bahar,triq censu tabone,

The incident happened in Naxxar Road, Birkirkara, on March 19, 2022. Esther Mifsud was arraigned before Magistrate Yana Micallef Stafrace and accused of dangerous and reckless driving, damaging the six parked cars due to negligence, and driving under the influence of alcohol. She denied the charges. The court observed that affidavits presented in court were â€œinconclusiveâ€ and â€œconfusingâ€ as to who was actually driving the vehicle at the time of the incident. It pointed out that jurisprudence laid down that the evidence on identity needs to be â€œclearâ€ and â€œunequivocalâ€. In this case the prosecution failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was driving the vehicle at the time of the incident and that she was driving under the influence. It was also noted that while the police had alleged that bodycam used by officers on the scene was switched on at the time of the incident, footage was never presented in court. â€œHad this evidence been presented, it would clearly have helped the court to identify the person behind the wheel,â€ Magistrate Yana Micallef Stafrace said.

Is the case being investigated? Is the driver facing any consequences? We are completely left in the dark.â€  While many commenters expressed solidarity with the father and others speculated that achieving justice would be a long and thankless journey that may not even be successful, one voice of encouragement stood out from the rest.Â  Bonnici urged Neidhardt not to give in to negativity and keep fighting to seek the truth about his son's death.Â  ""Don't give up on getting justice for your son! Keep voicing your frustration, keep emailing, get the media, do whatever it takes... just don't give up!"" she said.Â  ""Not giving up gives others the courage to fight for their rights!

article_3588.0,Danish father â€˜left in the darkâ€™ about son killed in car accident,"The father of a Danish man who died after being hit by a car in St Julianâ€™s a year and a half ago has been left in the dark as to what happened the night his son died. Asger Emil Neidhardt, a 25-year-old IT entrepreneur, arrived in Malta on October 22, 2023, for a holiday with friends. Six days later, he died after he was hit by a Honda Accord driven by a 44-year-old man in the Regional Road tunnels. While a police spokesperson said the family had been provided with updates on the investigation and the ongoing magisterial inquiry, Neidhardtâ€™s father disputed this claim. â€œTen days after the accident, my son arrived in Denmark in a coffin, and we never heard from the Maltese authorities about what happened to him,â€ Lars Neidhardt told Times of Malta. â€œItâ€™s very frustrating to lose oneâ€™s child and not know what happened. Is the case being investigated? Is the driver facing any consequences? We are completely left in the dark.â€ While details of the accident are scarce, Neidhardt was in touch with the friends who were the last to see Asger. That night the group had gone out, yet Asger did not return to his accommodation with the others. â€œHis friends called and texted him during the night, but he never answered,â€ he said. The next morning, the group headed to the police station to report their missing friend. There, a police officer informed them about the accident and asked them to identify the body. They confirmed it was Asger. Later in the day, Asgerâ€™s mother received a call from the Maltese police informing her that her son was killed in a car accident. Neidhardt then found online media reports about his sonâ€™s death. â€œOne minute he is out for dinner and drinks, and then the next thing I find out is that my son is dead,â€ Neidhardt said. Ten days later, Asgerâ€™s body arrived in Denmark. His father recalled how more than 300 people attended his funeral in Aabenraa, the town where he grew up. Countless calls and emails Following the funeral, the family contacted the Danish Embassy (based in Rome) to see how they could get more information on what happened to Asger. The ambassador advised them to contact the attorney general. Since Asgerâ€™s death, his father has sent eight emails to the attorney general and made countless phone calls, only to receive the same response each time: the magisterial inquiry has not yet been concluded. â€œIt is now more than one year since my son died in Malta, and I still havenâ€™t heard one word from the authorities in Malta,â€ Neidhardt wrote in his last email to the attorney general on December 6, 2024. â€œPlease be informed that the inquiry is not yet concluded,â€ was the response he received. Neidhardt has started to question if anything has happened since the accident. â€œI am never informed how long I have to wait for an update or if the case is still under investigation. Nothing.â€  In a reply to questions regarding the magisterial inquiry, a police spokesperson said while the inquiry is still ongoing the family have been updated on the investigations. â€œWhile the investigating officer communicates with the family since the victimâ€™s family resides abroad, they have been updated about the investigations and the inquiry through the Danish Consulate,â€ the spokesperson said. Neidhardt confirmed the family were never in touch with the authorities, nor did the Consulate reach out to them. â€œWe have heard absolutely nothing.â€ â€˜Spread joy because of his positive attitudeâ€™ Neidhardt recalled how his son loved life and enjoyed travelling around Europe with friends for new experiences. â€œHe was a very caring, loving and funny young man, he loved his family and friends above all,â€ he said. â€œHe spread joy in the family and his surroundings because of his positive attitude and energy.â€ The last time Lars saw his son was two weeks before he died, during a family weekend trip at a summer house. â€œI hugged him in the driveway before he drove off back home. I still canâ€™t believe that I will never see him again.â€ This is not the first time that family members have raised questions about Maltese authorities following an incident. In 2016, Mike Mansholt, a 17-year-old who came to Malta on holiday, was found dead at the foot of Dingli Cliffs. The Maltese magisterial inquiry concluded that Mike had died of natural causes and police closed the case. While the Maltese and German post-mortem concluded that the teenager had no broken bones, the Medical University of Hanover uncovered that Mike was devoid of the heart, brain, neck organs, lungs, liver, pancreas, adrenal glands, right kidney, bladder, stomach and the small intestine. His backpack, along with his phone and GoPro camera, were never found.

article_3220.0,Danish father is finally told driver will be charged over sonâ€™s death,"The driver who hit and killed a tourist in St Julianâ€™s more than a year ago will be charged in court, just weeks after theÂ Danish father spoke out publicly about authorities failing to update him about the case. Asger Emil Neidhardt, a 25-year-old IT entrepreneur, died on October 28, 2023, after he was hit by a Honda Accord driven by a 44-year-old man at the entrance of the Regional Road tunnels. His father, Lars Neidhardt, contacted Times of Malta three weeks ago to express his frustration after his requests for information about the fatal accident went ignored by the MalteseÂ authorities. He described how he was stonewalled by the police and the attorney general as he tried to get information on the progress of any investigation into the death. The Maltese police informed Neidhardt last Friday that the magisterial inquiry into his sonâ€™s death had been concluded and that the driver would be charged in court. â€œI am glad that we finally received some information about what happened,â€ Neidhardt told Times of Malta. He said it might be a â€œstrange coincidenceâ€ how the police reached out to him following a push by Times of Malta and the Danish media outlet TV2, yet, is relieved he finally receivedÂ information. â€œThis is the first proper and real information we received from Malta about my son,â€ he said. An e-mail sent by a member of the police victim support unit gives details on how investigations were concluded â€œsome weeks agoâ€ and the inquiry report by the magistrate had also been concluded.  â€œThe driver of the vehicle was detained on site and tested negative for alcohol,â€ the e-mail reads. The e-mail states that charges against the driver have been issued and the police are awaiting a date for the first court hearing. No details were provided on when the driver will be arraigned or the exact charges he will face. However, Neidhardt has been assured he will be kept informed as next of kin. In a reply to questions, a police spokesperson confirmed police investigations and the magisterial inquiry have been concluded. While Neidhardt said recounting the death of his son was â€œvery hardâ€, he was pleased he did, as it finally gave himÂ answers.Â  â€œGoing over all the e-mails from the attorney general, looking up pictures of Asger and having to recount his deathÂ has been very hard,â€ he said. â€œReliving the past was difficult but I am glad I did it and finally received some information.â€",04/02/2025,22/10/2023 22:00,regional road,st julians,Fatal,25,M,1,Pedestrian,not injured,44,M,0,Car,,,,,,,,,,,20231022,Fatal,1,delete,st julian,regional road,article_3558.0
article_167578.0,"Motorist fined â‚¬4,000 after grievously injuring woman using pelican crossing","A motorist has been fined â‚¬4,000 after being found guilty of grievously injuring a pedestrian after he crashed into a car waiting at a pelican crossing, sending it smashing into a woman crossing the road. St Paulâ€™s Bay resident Jithu James, 32, was accused of driving a vehicle in a dangerous, negligent and reckless manner and grievously injuring a pedestrian in an incident that occurred in October 2023. A motorist who was on his way home from work at the time of incident, explained he had been waiting for pedestrians to cross a pelican crossing on December 13 Road when he saw a vehicle being driven at an â€œabnormalâ€ speed. The speeding vehicle crashed into the witnessâ€™ car, which in turn hit a pedestrian using the crossing. The witness exited his vehicle, called the emergency services and went to assist a woman who was lying on the ground. In his testimony, he recalled that she was not in a â€œgoodâ€ state. Under cross-examination he confirmed he had stopped but not pulled up his handbrake. He also confirmed he had not been charged in connection with the incident. Another witness, who had been using the crossing at the time of the incident, explained he had been crossing the road with his dog, with a woman walking next to him. Two cars had been waiting for pedestrians to finish using the crossing, he recalled, when a third car crashed into one of the stationary cars. He added that his dog lost a tooth in the crash. The man remained with the woman until the ambulance came. The court in its considerations held that James failed to maintain a proper lookout while driving, especially when approaching a pedestrian crossing. The man was fined â‚¬4,000 and had 10 points knocked off his licence. He was disqualified from holding a driving licence for three months.

article_3861.0,Mother calls for stricter penalties after sonâ€™s road death,"The mother of a 21-year-old man who died in a traffic accident two years ago believes the courts are too lenient in suspending the licences of drivers responsible for serious or fatal collisions. Fiona Laferlaâ€™s son, Ben, was a passenger in a rental car driven by his friend, Maxime Asacha Muehlematter, when it crashed into a wall on Triq il-Madliena in Swieqi. Last month, Muehlematter received a suspended jail sentence and a one-year driving ban after admitting to involuntarily causing Benâ€™s death on September 24, 2022. Maltese traffic regulations stipulate a minimum driving ban of six months to a year, with courts having discretion over the final length based on the specific circumstances.  Lingering questions In court, it emerged that the front seatbelts were elongated but those at the back were stiff, indicating Ben and Flo had not been wearing them. After the crash, first aiders found Ben outside the car. A passer-by pulled him out to try to help. Maxâ€™s 17-year-old girlfriend initially claimed she was driving. She later admitted she lied, thinking her age would protect her from charges. She received a conditional discharge. A bottle of rum and another bottle of alcohol was found in the car, leading to public assumptions about the groupâ€™s behaviour. Fiona derides the â€œcallous commentsâ€ and clarifies that Ben had had the bottle of rum for weeks. Fiona remains unconvinced about the reported speed of 35km/hr, noting that Benâ€™s injuries seemed too severe. â€œYou know how many times my sister and I tried taking a sudden break at that speed to try to understand? I know that stupid things happen. In this case, there was a wall. But there are still questions.â€ The mother says the car safety element was never explored during the court case. â€œThere is always a fault â€“ but there are other things to consider that go beyond the driver: is the car properly maintained? Is the road too dark?â€ Fiona was hoping the court case would give her the answers. It did not, and she found it painful when a defence lawyer attempted to discredit Ben and Flo, even though they were sitting at the back. In the end, following a change of lawyer, Max admitted to causing Benâ€™s death. The prosecution withdrew charges relating to reckless and negligent driving as well as driving under the influence, because there was no material evidence that could lead to a conviction. â€œI wasnâ€™t hoping Max goes to prison because I wasnâ€™t out for vengeance. I donâ€™t want to persecute the boy. Ben loved him. He was his friend. That was meant to be down the road and coming back. You donâ€™t think itâ€™s going to happen to youâ€¦ Just because Ben is not here doesnâ€™t mean Max cannot have a life.â€ And now, Fiona says, her mission is to keep Benâ€™s memory alive. One way of doing it by promoting a â€˜Ben Lafestaâ€™ charity event, among other events in the pipeline. â€œThat keeps me going,â€ she says.",29/12/2024,24/09/2022 00:00,triq il-madliena,swieqi,Fatal,22,M,1,Car,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20220924,Fatal,1,retain,swieqi,triq il-madliena,
article_3653.0,Mother of road death victim calls out mistakes that lead to dropped court cases,"The mother of a 21-year-old man who died in a car crash has called out prosecution mistakes that lead to criminal court cases being dropped.Â  Fiona Laferla, whose son Ben died when the car his friend was driving crashed into a wall in Swieqi, said on Saturday that the indifference and callousness that family members of the deceased face in the justice system is another unnecessary wound in what is already a very difficult situation.Â  Speaking during Andrew Azzopardiâ€™s radio show on RTK 103, Laferala said she cannot understand how those who make mistakes - like writing the wrong date, address or detail down at the scenes of crimes or crashes - donâ€™t face any consequences for their actions.Â  â€œGod forbid I made mistakes of this calibre while teaching, you would never hear the end of it,â€ she said.Â  â€œBut isnâ€™t it bad enough that youâ€™ve lost a loved one, a husband or a child, and on a technicality you lose your chance to get closure as well?â€Â  Laferla also criticised policymakers for not acting on what are clear shortcomings in the system. I worry that eventually, everyone becomes immune to these deaths until it impacts them,â€ she said.Â  â€œThe worst thing that can strike you is indifference, and that is why I donâ€™t understand the policymakers.â€Â  She was also critical of the cold approach relatives are faced with when finding themselves in the court system.Â  â€œI saw this indifference first-hand in court with the first lawyer that (the driver of the car) had,â€ she continued.Â  â€œIâ€™m a generally calm person but there was one occasion where I wanted to throw something at him. He tried to ridicule me, tried to paint Ben and his girlfriend in the worst light possible and was bringing up things that had nothing to do with the case at all.â€ Last year Maxime Asacha Muehlematter, the 22-year-old who was driving the car that Ben died in, admitted to causing his death and was handed a suspended sentence and a one-year driving ban. Muehlematter was cleared of drink-driving charges as prosecutors had no evidence to prove that charge. Initially another passenger in the car, a girl who was 17 at the time, told police she was the one driving the car.Â  The girl later admitted she had lied and that Muehlematter was the driver. She was given a conditional discharge.Â Â   Laferla told Times of Malta last year that while she was not out for revenge and did not want to see the young man go to prison, she felt that he should have received a longer driving ban, if barring him from driving forever was not a possibility.Â  Bringing this point up again on Saturday, she said that these are the issues policymakers should be addressing, particularly as road deaths are not isolated incidents and continue to claim peopleâ€™s lives senselessly year after year.Â  â€œI knew that it was going to be a slap on the wrist because I had seen what happened in other cases,â€ she said.Â  â€œWe were lucky that he admitted and the process was not long and drawn out. But when youâ€™ve already lost your son thatâ€™s not saying much. Donâ€™t the people on top see these things?â€ she questioned.",11/01/2025,24/09/2022 00:00,triq il-madliena,swieqi,Fatal,22,M,1,car,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20220924,Fatal,1,delete,swieqi,triq il-madliena,article_3861.0

In February 2022, 28-year-old Nepali delivery driver Ajay Shrestha died when a truck overturned on Marsaâ€™s Aldo Moro Road. The vehicle ploughed into a lamppost before spilling its load of scrap metal onto oncoming traffic, fatally crushing Shrestha. Shrestha, known to friends as â€˜AJâ€™, had moved to Malta from Nepal in 2018 in search of work. Just a week before the accident, he had celebrated his 28th birthday. â€œIt has been three years now since my brotherâ€™s death, and nothing has happened. Nobody has contacted me,â€ Ajayâ€™s older brother, Anil, told Times of Malta.  Anil recalled how his sibling always had a smile on his face and, during his time in Malta, made a lot of friends. â€œHe was very passionate about sport, he played cricket back at home and loved to play music. He was never angry with anyone and was just a very good person.â€ He said the two were always together from childhood until the fatal accident changed that. â€œAll my family wants is justice for Ajay.

article_1352.0,"Motorcyclist injured in pothole incident awarded â‚¬74,000","A 39-year-old Turkish national has been awarded over â‚¬74,000 in damages following an accident in SiÄ¡Ä¡iewi which left him suffering from a permanent disability. The man was driving his Piaggio Vespa along Triq GÄ§ar Lapsi on May 2, 2020, when he stumbled into a pothole, lost his balance and fell off the motorcycle. He was taken to Mater Dei Hospital where he was certified with grievous injuries. Following the incident, the man returned to Turkey since he needed treatment, and the coronavirus pandemic had hit. He also underwent several surgical interventions. As a result of the incident, he sustained permanent disability, which harmed his quality of life. The man eventually returned to Malta. Through his lawyers, he filed an application before the First Hall of the Civil Court, suing the SiÄ¡Ä¡iewi Local Council and Infrastructure Malta. He requested the court to hold both responsible for the incident and order them to pay him damages. Both Infrastructure Malta and the SiÄ¡Ä¡iewi local council argued that they were not suited, with the road agency arguing that the council was responsible for maintaining the road, while the local council argued that it was in the hands of the agency. In court, the man testified that as he was driving along Triq GÄ§ar Lapsi, direction towards Dingli cliffs, a few meters after he turned the corner, the condition of the road changed dramatically. Who is responsible for the road? He described how the road level went down by a few metres before he drove into a pothole. Moreover, there were no signs that the road surface would deteriorate, and the man said he had no reason to believe that the road surface would change in such a manner. John Fenech from Elles Urban Services Ltd â€“ a company engaged by the council to maintain the roads â€“ acknowledged that the road was in a state of disrepair and it had to be resurfaced. He also testified that the damage to the road was primarily attributable to the frequent passage of heavy vehicles in the service of nearby quarries. He added that the road was not built to take the weight of the vehicles. A police constable similarly testified that the road was in a bad state, noting that there were several cracks in the asphalt and potholes. In establishing who was responsible for the road, the court heard architect David Vassallo from Infrastructure Malta. The witness said the road fell under the responsibility of the local council, however, the road agency intervened and issued an emergency allocation to contractor Philip Agius and Sons for â‚¬1.5 million, excluding VAT, in December 2020. The councilâ€™s executive secretary, Ritianne Giorgino, told the court that while it was within the councilâ€™s boundary, the local council is responsible for maintenance or patching works, while resurfacing falls under the responsibility of the local government. Referring to the mayorâ€™s affidavit, the court observed that while it was outlined that the council has several structures to monitor and ascertain that roads are kept in a good state of repair, this was not the case and notwithstanding the â€œlayers of surveillance adopted by the Council, somewhere down the line, somebody is not doing his job properly or else the technical operandi is not functioning."" The court reminded how the road is used by heavy vehicles and therefore, the road should have been monitored more closely and frequently. It also observed that it was only after the plaintiff was injured that the road was properly repaired. The court concluded that the council was wholly to blame for the accident.Â  When it came to calculating damages, it took into consideration that 21 months after the accident, the manâ€™s radial nerve did not make a full recovery, and this was most likely improbable. It also took into consideration the court-appointed expertâ€™s observations on the fracture of the distal tibia, which involved an articular surface of the ankle joint and will inevitably lead to arthritic change. The motorcyclist also ended up with substantial amounts of metal implants attached to the humerus and tibia. These foreign bodies provide a slightly increased risk of bone infection during bacetermia, according to the expert. After calculating the damages, the court declared the SiÄ¡Ä¡iewi local council responsible for the incident and ordered it to pay the man â‚¬74,873. Mr Justice Toni Abela presided over the court.

article_353524.0,Elderly man acquitted of traffic fatality as victim is blamed,"A man has been acquitted of causing the death of a pedestrian in Paola in 2018 after finding that the victim caused the incident through negligence and the motorist could do nothing about it. The accident happened at Triq Wied Bladun on May 13, 2018. George Glanville, now 83, from Fgura was accused of having caused the death of his friend, William Cocker. The court heard that on that day, Glanville was driving his Kia Rio on a clear road. The traffic light was green. Behind him a man rode a motorcycle accompanied by a passenger. Cocker suddenly emerged from behind a wall and attempted to cross the road straight in front of Glanvilleâ€™s car. Glanville told the police he was driving at 40-50 km/hr and stopped the vehicle immediately the accident happened. He got out of his car and spoke to Cocker who was still responsive. He only left the scene after the police allowed him to. Glanville told the police that he was sorry for what had happened, since Cocker was his friend and he had known him for a long time. He also kept visiting Cocker in hospital every two days until his death on May 31. Â  The motorcyclist who had been following Glanville testified that Cocker just crossed the road suddenly. Glanville hit the pedestrian and stopped the car immediately. The man recalled assisting the driver and the victim, who were two elderly men and knew each other. Another eyewitness said that the pedestrian was crossing on the pedestrian crossing when the lights were green for vehicles. Superintendent Hubert Cini testified that Cockerâ€™s injuries were certified as grievous; however, he was not seen at risk of dying at the time. A post-mortem investigation determined, however, that Cockerâ€™s death was a result of the incident. In their submissions on punishment, the prosecution said the charges were issued after the post-mortem examination showed that the victimâ€™s death was caused by the incident. It also argued that while the pedestrian crossed when the lights were green for vehicles, the driver failed to keep a proper lookout. The defence countered that the victim crossed the road without proper look-out when he should not have even crossed. The driver had no time to react. The court referred to the eyewitnesses who testified how Cocker just crossed the road without waiting for the red lights for vehicles. From their testimony, it emerged that the accused could not reasonably have avoided the incident. The court said that it was convinced that the accused was driving responsibly. The evidence showed that the victim had been negligent in this case and that it led to the unfortunate incident. â€œFor this reason, one cannot say that the accused did not keep a proper look out since the victimâ€™s action was unpredictable and there was nothing that the accused could have done to avoid the incident,â€ Magistrate Nadine Sant Lia observed. The court ruled that the incident was caused by Cockerâ€™s imprudence, which created an unpredictable emergency that made it impossible and unreasonable for the accused to take timely action and avoid the incident. Glanville was acquitted of having caused Cockerâ€™s death through negligent driving. Magistrate Nadine Sant Lia presided over the case. Superintendent Hubert Cini prosecuted.",23/07/2025,13/03/2018 00:00,triq wied bladun,paola,Fatal,83,M,0,Car,Fatal,none,M,1,Pedestrian,,,,,,,,,,,20180313,Fatal,1,retain,paola,triq wied bladun,
article_2101.0,Driver jailed for four years for killing passenger in 2017 car crash,"A 48-year-old man has been jailed for four years for causing the death of a passenger in his car during a collision in August 2017. St Paulâ€™s Bay resident Godfrey Gambin was charged with the involuntary homicide of Jane Mary Turner, 45. He was also accused of causing involuntary bodily harm on another driver, causing damages to the other car and violating traffic rules. Police sergeant Denise Camilleri told the court that she was stationed at Mosta Police Station on August 20 2017 when she got the call about a collision on Triq Sir Temi Zammit in MÄ¡arr. The sergeant went on site and found Gambinâ€™s car had overturned, the driver was standing outside and had blood over him. Turner, who was inside Gambinâ€™s car, died on site. The other vehicle was on the pavement in the opposite direction. Gambin was hospitalised and was in intensive care for some time. The other driver told the court that he was going to GÄ§adira and was driving towards MÄ¡arr when he saw an oncoming car coming in the opposite direction in his lane. He had no time to avoid the collision and Gambin crashed his vehicle into the manâ€™s car.  The vehicle spun twice before ending up on the pavement. The windscreen shattered. The driver recalled that when he got out of his car, he found Gambinâ€™s car overturned and the female passenger dead on site. The court, presided over by magistrate Caroline Farrugia Frendo, found Gambin guilty and jailed him for four years. He was fined â‚¬11,600 and his driving licence was suspended for three months as from 2 April 2025. Gambin was also ordered to pay â‚¬2,975.91 in court expenses.

article_3834.0,"Driver paid for damages he was never accused of causing, court hears","A driver who was conditionally discharged over a collision that took place 18 years ago, paid for damages to the other driverâ€™s vehicle when he was never charged with causing such damages but only for injuries suffered by that driverâ€™s passenger. Emanuel Gatt was targeted by criminal charges following the accident which took place in Triq il-Mithna, Qormi on December 17, 2006 when he was involved in a collision which resulted in grievous injuries to a woman in the other car. Gatt was subsequently prosecuted for careless and dangerous driving, driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, having an alcohol level beyond the legal limits as well as causing grievous injuries to the woman. The proceedings dragged on until earlier this year, when the case was assigned to a new magistrate. Eighteen years down the line, Gatt registered an admission to three of the charges, including that related to the injuries involuntarily caused to the victim. When examining the evidence to determine whether Gatt was guilty of the other charges the court, presided over by Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech, observed that the only witness who testified in the proceedings was a medical doctor who confirmed that the victim fractured a left-hand finger. She also suffered neck and shoulder injuries. The injuries were classified as grievous because of the fracture Despite the fact that the doctor was the only witness, the proceedings dragged on for 17 years. A court minute dated March 28, 2008 indicated that the driver of the other car had claimed damages to the tune of â‚¬1700. That amount included court expenses. But what was most concerning was the fact that his name was not even mentioned in that court minute. Much less so did he testify, observed the magistrate when delivering judgment. Nor was there any receipt or a single scrap of documentary evidence to support his claim for damages. Yet, while the case dragged on, the accused made â‚¬300 payments to someone named Etienne Bugeja. He appeared to be a relative of the victim and was driving the car at the time of the crash. That fact was understood through the police current incident report which, however, was never confirmed on oath. The magistrate was â€œmost astonishedâ€ by the fact that the court, as previously presided, had permitted such payments for damages allegedly caused to Bugejaâ€™s car when the accused was never charged with causing damage to third party property but only for injuring the passenger. And although he claimed damages totalling â‚¬1700, Bugeja was never even formally identified in the court records. In light of such evidence and the circumstances of the case, the court cleared Gatt of the other charges whilst conditionally discharging him for 40 months over those charges he pleaded guilty to. When meting out punishment, the court took into consideration Gattâ€™s criminal record and the fact that the case had â€œinexplicablyâ€ dragged on for 17 years. The court also imposed a three-month driving ban.",30/12/2024,17/12/2006 00:00,triq il-mithna,qormi,Grievious,Unknown,Unknown,1,Car,not injured,Unknown,M,0,Car,,,,,,,,,,,20061217,Grievious,1,retain,qormi,triq il-mithna,

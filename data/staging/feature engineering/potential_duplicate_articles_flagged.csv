3861.0,Mother calls for stricter penalties after son’s road death,"The mother of a 21-year-old man who died in a traffic accident two years ago believes the courts are too lenient in suspending the licences of drivers responsible for serious or fatal collisions. Fiona Laferla’s son, Ben, was a passenger in a rental car driven by his friend, Maxime Asacha Muehlematter, when it crashed into a wall on Triq il-Madliena in Swieqi. Last month, Muehlematter received a suspended jail sentence and a one-year driving ban after admitting to involuntarily causing Ben’s death on September 24, 2022. Maltese traffic regulations stipulate a minimum driving ban of six months to a year, with courts having discretion over the final length based on the specific circumstances.  Lingering questions In court, it emerged that the front seatbelts were elongated but those at the back were stiff, indicating Ben and Flo had not been wearing them. After the crash, first aiders found Ben outside the car. A passer-by pulled him out to try to help. Max’s 17-year-old girlfriend initially claimed she was driving. She later admitted she lied, thinking her age would protect her from charges. She received a conditional discharge. A bottle of rum and another bottle of alcohol was found in the car, leading to public assumptions about the group’s behaviour. Fiona derides the “callous comments” and clarifies that Ben had had the bottle of rum for weeks. Fiona remains unconvinced about the reported speed of 35km/hr, noting that Ben’s injuries seemed too severe. “You know how many times my sister and I tried taking a sudden break at that speed to try to understand? I know that stupid things happen. In this case, there was a wall. But there are still questions.” The mother says the car safety element was never explored during the court case. “There is always a fault – but there are other things to consider that go beyond the driver: is the car properly maintained? Is the road too dark?” Fiona was hoping the court case would give her the answers. It did not, and she found it painful when a defence lawyer attempted to discredit Ben and Flo, even though they were sitting at the back. In the end, following a change of lawyer, Max admitted to causing Ben’s death. The prosecution withdrew charges relating to reckless and negligent driving as well as driving under the influence, because there was no material evidence that could lead to a conviction. “I wasn’t hoping Max goes to prison because I wasn’t out for vengeance. I don’t want to persecute the boy. Ben loved him. He was his friend. That was meant to be down the road and coming back. You don’t think it’s going to happen to you… Just because Ben is not here doesn’t mean Max cannot have a life.” And now, Fiona says, her mission is to keep Ben’s memory alive. One way of doing it by promoting a ‘Ben Lafesta’ charity event, among other events in the pipeline. “That keeps me going,” she says.",2024-12-29,2022-09-24 00:00:00,True,Triq il-Madliena,Swieqi,Fatal,22,M,1,Car,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,no,no,no,yes,Night,Fatal,1.0,2022-09-2400:00:00,triqil-madliena,swieqi,True,[3653.0]
3588.0,Danish father ‘left in the dark’ about son killed in car accident,"The father of a Danish man who died after being hit by a car in St Julian’s a year and a half ago has been left in the dark as to what happened the night his son died. Asger Emil Neidhardt, a 25-year-old IT entrepreneur, arrived in Malta on October 22, 2023, for a holiday with friends. Six days later, he died after he was hit by a Honda Accord driven by a 44-year-old man in the Regional Road tunnels. While a police spokesperson said the family had been provided with updates on the investigation and the ongoing magisterial inquiry, Neidhardt’s father disputed this claim. “Ten days after the accident, my son arrived in Denmark in a coffin, and we never heard from the Maltese authorities about what happened to him,” Lars Neidhardt told Times of Malta. “It’s very frustrating to lose one’s child and not know what happened. Is the case being investigated? Is the driver facing any consequences? We are completely left in the dark.” While details of the accident are scarce, Neidhardt was in touch with the friends who were the last to see Asger. That night the group had gone out, yet Asger did not return to his accommodation with the others. “His friends called and texted him during the night, but he never answered,” he said. The next morning, the group headed to the police station to report their missing friend. There, a police officer informed them about the accident and asked them to identify the body. They confirmed it was Asger. Later in the day, Asger’s mother received a call from the Maltese police informing her that her son was killed in a car accident. Neidhardt then found online media reports about his son’s death. “One minute he is out for dinner and drinks, and then the next thing I find out is that my son is dead,” Neidhardt said. Ten days later, Asger’s body arrived in Denmark. His father recalled how more than 300 people attended his funeral in Aabenraa, the town where he grew up. Countless calls and emails Following the funeral, the family contacted the Danish Embassy (based in Rome) to see how they could get more information on what happened to Asger. The ambassador advised them to contact the attorney general. Since Asger’s death, his father has sent eight emails to the attorney general and made countless phone calls, only to receive the same response each time: the magisterial inquiry has not yet been concluded. “It is now more than one year since my son died in Malta, and I still haven’t heard one word from the authorities in Malta,” Neidhardt wrote in his last email to the attorney general on December 6, 2024. “Please be informed that the inquiry is not yet concluded,” was the response he received. Neidhardt has started to question if anything has happened since the accident. “I am never informed how long I have to wait for an update or if the case is still under investigation. Nothing.”  In a reply to questions regarding the magisterial inquiry, a police spokesperson said while the inquiry is still ongoing the family have been updated on the investigations. “While the investigating officer communicates with the family since the victim’s family resides abroad, they have been updated about the investigations and the inquiry through the Danish Consulate,” the spokesperson said. Neidhardt confirmed the family were never in touch with the authorities, nor did the Consulate reach out to them. “We have heard absolutely nothing.” ‘Spread joy because of his positive attitude’ Neidhardt recalled how his son loved life and enjoyed travelling around Europe with friends for new experiences. “He was a very caring, loving and funny young man, he loved his family and friends above all,” he said. “He spread joy in the family and his surroundings because of his positive attitude and energy.” The last time Lars saw his son was two weeks before he died, during a family weekend trip at a summer house. “I hugged him in the driveway before he drove off back home. I still can’t believe that I will never see him again.” This is not the first time that family members have raised questions about Maltese authorities following an incident. In 2016, Mike Mansholt, a 17-year-old who came to Malta on holiday, was found dead at the foot of Dingli Cliffs. The Maltese magisterial inquiry concluded that Mike had died of natural causes and police closed the case. While the Maltese and German post-mortem concluded that the teenager had no broken bones, the Medical University of Hanover uncovered that Mike was devoid of the heart, brain, neck organs, lungs, liver, pancreas, adrenal glands, right kidney, bladder, stomach and the small intestine. His backpack, along with his phone and GoPro camera, were never found. In 2021, Mansholt’s father asked the German courts to order the Maltese authorities to reopen investigations into his son’s mysterious death.",2025-01-16,2023-10-22 22:00:00,True,Regional Road,St Julian's,Fatal,25,M,1,Pedestrian,not injured,44,M,0,Car,,,,,,,,,,,no,no,no,yes,late evening,Fatal,1.0,2023-10-2222:00:00,regionalroad,stjulian's,True,[3558.0]

4110.0,Skip involved in horror St Paul’s Bay bypass crash 'did not have permit',"A private contractor who placed a skip on St Paul's Bay bypass that was involved in a serious road accident on Wednesday did not have a permit, local authorities say.  The mayor of St Paul’s Bay, Infrastructure Malta, and Transport Malta all said they did not grant permission for the unnamed contractor to place a skip on the road on Wednesday.  A 54-year-old motorcyclist was seriously injured when he crashed into the stationary garbage skip left on a blind bend along the bypass.  Transport Malta said it ""was not informed about the works, and the contractor did not hold a valid permit to carry out works at the site where the accident occurred.""  Similarly, Infrastructure Malta said it ""had not been notified about the works, and no permission was requested for them."" However, it acknowledged that the accident occurred near works being carried out by a private contractor under its administration. It did not name the contractor involved. In October, Infrastructure Malta began work to replace a dangerous leaning wall along the same bypass section where the accident happened. St Paul’s Bay Mayor, Censu Galea, also confirmed that the council had not issued any permits. ""No permits were ever issued as far as I am informed,"" he said. He said he was told the skip was placed on the road at around 1pm on Wednesday. The incident was reported to the police at around 5pm.  The mayor noted that the same skip had been in the same location two to three months ago, and people raised safety concerns with the council at the time. He explained that once he was informed, the council alerted Infrastructure Malta, which added cones and bollards at that time. The skip involved in Wednesday’s accident was left at the final curve leading to the Xemxija roundabout. According to the police, the injured motorcyclist, an English man from Mellieħa, lost control of his Honda and collided with the skip. He remains in Mater Dei Hospital with serious injuries. While traffic cones and a bollard were at the site, an eyewitness and social media users described these safety features as insufficient.",2024-12-12,2024-12-11 17:00:00,True,St Paul’s Bay bypass,St Paul's Bay,Serious,54,M,1,Motorbike,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,no,no,no,no,afternoon,Serious,1.0,2024-12-1117:00:00,stpaul’sbaybypass,stpaul'sbay,True,[4067.0]
4024.0,‘I’m tired of going to friends’ funerals’: bikers' anger after skip crash death,"The president of a motorcycle advocacy group has expressed his anger at the perceived negligence of the authorities, which he says led to the death of a biker last week. Dieter Vink, 54, died last Friday, two days after crashing his motorcycle into a skip positioned on the final curve of the St Paul’s Bay bypass before the Xemxija roundabout.  “I’m sick of going to funerals. It feels like our lives are cheap,” Galea said, mentioning the deaths of Johanna Boni, after being hit by a truck in 2015, and Marie Claire Lombardi, who lost control of her bike after it skidded on olives spilled onto the road in 2022. Speaking about the experience of riding a motorcycle more generally, Galea said it had become more dangerous to drive on Malta’s roads over the past four or five years. “I think it’s because drivers are frustrated by the ever-increasing traffic, which in turn leads them to drive in an impatient and careless manner. Right now, the situation feels like it’s beyond repair,” he said. Aldo Overend, a committee member of the NGO, echoed Galea’s sentiments.  “We just hope this accident will lead to action because we can’t go on like this,"" he said. ""While riding, I feel like I constantly have to dodge heavy vehicles, construction materials, fresh concrete and water leaking from bowsers, as well as reckless car drivers not taking us into account."" Official data shows almost 40 per cent of all road traffic casualties involve motorcyclists.  Vink’s family and friends have vowed to get justice for his death and are seeking legal advice. A GoFundMe page has been set up to raise funds to cover funeral and legal expenses, along with a fundraising bike ride planned for December 28, starting at Mater Dei Hospital and ending at Vink’s second home, The Pitstop in Xemxija.",2024-12-17,2024-12-11 17:00:00,True,St Paul’s Bay bypass,St Paul’s Bay,Fatal,54,M,1,Motorbike,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,no,no,no,no,afternoon,Fatal,1.0,2024-12-1117:00:00,stpaul’sbaybypass,stpaul’sbay,True,[2975.0]

490746.0,"Drunk cab driver was waiting for passengers before crash into salon, court hears","A cab driver who was over the legal alcohol limit when he crashed into a Santa Venera hair salon told police he had been waiting for passengers, a court has heard. Abdi Salaan Mahamad Abditon Ali had a reading of 107.3 micrograms of alcohol per 100 ml breath, when the legal limit for cab drivers is zero, after the crash into Marica’s Salon, on Cannon Road, on August 7. A court on Monday heard that he gave a statement to police, in which he said he was waiting for passengers just before the collision. ""Thank God no one requested a cab… It could have resulted in fatalities,” police inspector Nathan Bugeja told the court.   The 42-year-old Somali national stands accused of driving in a negligent, dangerous and reckless manner, causing damage to third property, and driving under influence. He denies the charges. The salon was still closed at the time of the incident and there were no injuries. A police constable testified about receiving a call regarding the collision, with the initial information stating that the vehicle had crashed into a “house”. When the witness got onsite, he found the owner, Marica Baldacchino, who had not seen the incident. The witness went to Mater Dei Hospital where he spoke to the driver. He returned back when another constable was subjecting the driver to the a breathalyzer test. The constable underlined that a cab driver’s limit is 0 μg/100ml. During Monday’s sitting, the prosecution and defence made submissions on bail. Police inspector Bugeja objected due to the seriousness of the crime.  Bugeja also highlighted that although the man’s address on his official documents and the charge sheet state that he lives in St Paul’s Bay, the police accompanied him to a Ħamrun address to collect his passport. Defence lawyer Francesca Zarb counter-argued that the defendant has been in Malta since 2008 and this was his first brush with the law. He was granted subsidiary protection and has a residence permit. The lawyer observed that the court as presided hears cases on traffic collisions and argued that individuals with the same charges are brought before it under summons not under arrest. Zarb also argued that whether the man is granted bail or otherwise, the amount of damages would not be affected. Bugeja rebutted the argument stating that usually collisions do not involve third parties, nor do they involve damages running into thousands of euros. While an exact figure was not given during Monday’s sitting, the damages sustained are between €10,000 to €15,000. These will be confirmed once the salon owner takes the stand. The police inspector also added that the man poses a risk to the public. Zarb observed that two of Ali’s friends were present in the courtroom, with one of them willing to host him. The friend told the court that he came to Malta in 2006 and has known the accused for the past eight years. The court then asked the accused whether he held a bank account, signalling it was willing to grant bail, only if a bank guarantee could be made. After establishing that Ali lacked a bank account with a local bank through which he could guarantee at least €10,000 in favour of the victim, the court denied the man bail. In its decision, the court held that it does not have the peace of mind he would be able to satisfy all conditions otherwise imposed by the court in a bail decree, even though at this stage, the man is presumed innocent until proven guilty. The case continues later this month.

Yoana Valentinova Gatt, a 44-year-old Bulgarian national living in St Paul’s Bay, admitted earlier this week to causing grievous bodily harm through negligence to the motorcyclist, damaging the victim’s motorcycle, driving under the influence and drink driving. She denies the reckless driving charge, and the case continues with respect to that charge. The incident took place on August 17 when Valentinova Gatt hit the motorcycle from the rear, injuring its driver, a 53-year-old Belgian national living in Gżira. Eyewitnesses who testified earlier this week explained how five men had lifted the woman’s car, which had its engine still running, to free the trapped motorcyclist. The motorcyclist was placed in the recovery position until the emergency services arrived at the scene. A breathalyser test revealed Valentinova Gatt was six times over the legal limit, with the test marking 124.9 μg/100ml (microgrammes of alcohol per 100ml breath).

495731.0,Autopsy results of Croatia car tragedy victims expected on Monday,"Autopsy results of the two couples who died when their rental car plunged into the sea while on holiday in Croatia will be published on Monday.  Croatian sources told Times of Malta the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Rijeka, which is carrying out the autopsies, will have details of the results on Monday.  Jeremy Gambin, 68, and his wife Lorraine, 67, died alongside Kevin Bonnici, 67, and his wife Alexandra, 66. They were travelling together on the scenic Adriatic Coast when the car they were in veered off the road and into the sea on Thursday afternoon. The four were good friends and all lived in Swieqi.  Autopsy results could help shed light on the dynamics of the crash, with Croatian media having reported that the initial suspicion is that the person driving the vehicle may have become ill while driving, leading to the crash.   Jeremy Gambin was a basketball coach at Luxol and a former player who represented Malta at the 1987 Games of Small States of Europe in Monaco. He was also a PE Teacher at St Michael’s Foundation. He and his wife Lorraine, whose official name is Cynthia, had three children and several grandchildren.   Kevin Bonnici worked in the cab business and served as a company director of two separate Y-Plate fleet firms. He previously worked for Air Malta in the airline's finance, flight ops and engineering departments. He and his wife Alexandra had two children and various grandchildren.   Sources told Times of Malta that family members were travelling to Croatia on Saturday, and forensics will continue with the autopsy.  The accident happened at 4.20pm on Thursday, on the D8 state road near Bunica, just south of Senj. Police said the vehicle, travelling from Rijeka towards Senj, is believed to have lost control on a left-hand bend, veered right, struck two stone barriers and fell around 70 metres down a ravine before ending up in the water. Police officer Jasmin Mujaković from the Senj Police Station was among the first to arrive at the scene of the horrific accident, 24sata reported. He surfaced several times for air and then went down under the surface again, trying to find a way to reach the victims. A Croatian diver with over 30 years of experience has described Thursday’s fatal car accident that killed four Maltese tourists as the most difficult intervention of his career. Renato Huba said that while he had similar interventions before, he described the accident as “one of the most difficult”, he told Croatian newsroom. “I prepared myself for the worst situation, but that was not enough; this was much worse,” Huba said.",2025-10-04,2025-10-02 00:00:00,True,D8 state road,Senj,Fatal,none,none,4,car,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,no,no,no,no,Night,Fatal,4.0,2025-10-0200:00:00,d8stateroad,senj,True,[495595.0]
495896.0,Couples killed in Croatia travelled together for 30 years without an accident,"The two Maltese couples killed when their car plunged into the sea in Croatia last Thursday had been travelling together for more than 30 years and had never experienced a single accident. The victims – Jeremy and Lorraine Gambin and Kevin and Sandra Bonnici – were lifelong friends and cousins who regularly holidayed together across Europe and beyond. “They were not only cousins but best friends who travelled all over the world together. They’ve driven around together for tens of thousands of kilometres,” Justin Gambin, one of the victims’ sons told Times of Malta. The fatal crash occurred on the D8 state road near Bunica, close to the coastal town of Senj, when their rented car struck two stone barriers and fell some 70 metres into the sea below. Croatian emergency divers described the recovery operation as one of the most difficult they had ever carried out.  Relatives of the victims, including their children, are currently in Senj, where on Monday they laid flowers near the crash site in memory of their loved ones. In their first comments to the media since the tragedy, the Gambin and Bonnici families expressed deep gratitude to the Croatian authorities and local community for the “incredible support” shown in the aftermath of the tragedy.  All the victims’ personal belongings have since been returned to the families who are now waiting for the autopsy results.  Meanwhile, questions have been raised about the safety of the D8 road, where certain stretches lack adequate barriers to prevent cars from plunging into the sea below. ""While the stone bollards along the road may appear protective, they were likely insufficient to prevent a vehicle from veering off the road,” said Jonathan Gambin, whose 68-year-old brother was among the victims. Gambin said the family hopes that further investigations into the accident will bring some kind of closure.  The tragedy shocked Malta and is believed to be the highest death toll of a crash involving Maltese nationals abroad.  It came almost exactly a month after another Maltese couple, Doris and Manuel Buhagiar, were killed in a car crash in Sicily.",2025-10-06,2025-10-02 00:00:00,True,D8 state road,Senj,Fatal,68,M,1,Car,Fatal,none,F,1,Car,Fatal,none,M,1.0,Car,Fatal,none,F,1.0,Car,no,no,no,no,Night,Fatal,4.0,2025-10-0200:00:00,d8stateroad,senj,True,"[495595.0, 495731.0]"

Jeremy and Lorraine Gambin and their best friends Kevin and Sandra Bonnici were killed last Thursday when their Land Rover Discovery plunged off a cliff and veered into the sea on the D8 state road near Bunica, just south of Senj. The funeral of the Gambin couple will be held on Saturday at Balluta church at 9.30am, the victims' son Justin Gambin told Times of Malta. The date of the funeral of the other couple is not yet known.  The four - aged between 66 and 68 - were lifelong friends who regularly holidayed abroad together. In a statement to Times of Malta, the Gambin family said: ""Jeremy and Lorraine, humble and loved by all, lived life to the fullest. They left us doing what they loved most with their best friends."" Drowning most likely cause of death Meanwhile, autopsy results reported by Croatian media say drowning was the most likely cause of death of the two couples, as only slight injuries were found on the bodies. All four are believed to have been wearing seatbelts. Forensic investigations are ongoing with experts unable to determine what caused the car to veer off the road. Initial reports in the Croatian media that the driver of the vehicle may have become ill while driving, thus leading to the crash, were not verified by the autopsy. The vehicle fell around 70 metres after veering off the road, before crashing into the sea to a depth of at least 11 metres. The investigation was conducted by forensic medicine specialists from the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Rijeka. Relatives of the four victims, including their children, laid flowers near the crash site in memory of their loved ones.  Justin Gambin said his father and Kevin Bonnici were “not only cousins but best friends who travelled all over the world together. They’ve driven around together for tens of thousands of kilometres”. Speaking to Times of Malta on Wednesday, he thanked the Croatian police in Senj for their assistance.  Questions on safety of road Meanwhile, questions have been raised about the safety of the D8 road, where certain stretches lack adequate barriers to prevent cars from plunging into the sea below. Jonathan Gambin, whose brother was among the victims, said that while stone bollards along the road “may appear protective, they were likely insufficient to prevent a vehicle from veering off the road”. He had expressed hope that further investigations into the accident would bring the victims’ relatives a measure of closure. It is not known whether the Senj Bora, the notorious strong northeasterly wind that blows along the Adriatic coast of Croatia, could have potentially contributed to the accident. There has also been some speculation in the Croatian media that an oncoming car could also have distracted the Maltese driver.  Croatian emergency divers described the operation to recover the car involved in the crash as one of the most difficult they had ever carried out, with experienced diver Renato Huba telling local media that while he had prepared for the worst, “this was much worse”. A member of the towing service praised a policeman who was among the first to arrive on the scene and who dived into the water in an attempt to open the door of the car damaged by the force of impact. ""He tried everything he could. He jumped, dived, tried to open the door, but due to the extensive damage and the strong water pressure, it was simply not possible.

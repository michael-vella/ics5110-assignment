article_3834.0,"Driver paid for damages he was never accused of causing, court hears","A driver who was conditionally discharged over a collision that took place 18 years ago, paid for damages to the other driverâ€™s vehicle when he was never charged with causing such damages but only for injuries suffered by that driverâ€™s passenger. Emanuel Gatt was targeted by criminal charges following the accident which took place in Triq il-Mithna, Qormi on December 17, 2006 when he was involved in a collision which resulted in grievous injuries to a woman in the other car. Gatt was subsequently prosecuted for careless and dangerous driving, driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, having an alcohol level beyond the legal limits as well as causing grievous injuries to the woman. The proceedings dragged on until earlier this year, when the case was assigned to a new magistrate. Eighteen years down the line, Gatt registered an admission to three of the charges, including that related to the injuries involuntarily caused to the victim. When examining the evidence to determine whether Gatt was guilty of the other charges the court, presided over by Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech, observed that the only witness who testified in the proceedings was a medical doctor who confirmed that the victim fractured a left-hand finger. She also suffered neck and shoulder injuries. The injuries were classified as grievous because of the fracture Despite the fact that the doctor was the only witness, the proceedings dragged on for 17 years. A court minute dated March 28, 2008 indicated that the driver of the other car had claimed damages to the tune of â‚¬1700. That amount included court expenses. But what was most concerning was the fact that his name was not even mentioned in that court minute. Much less so did he testify, observed the magistrate when delivering judgment. Nor was there any receipt or a single scrap of documentary evidence to support his claim for damages. Yet, while the case dragged on, the accused made â‚¬300 payments to someone named Etienne Bugeja. He appeared to be a relative of the victim and was driving the car at the time of the crash. That fact was understood through the police current incident report which, however, was never confirmed on oath. The magistrate was â€œmost astonishedâ€ by the fact that the court, as previously presided, had permitted such payments for damages allegedly caused to Bugejaâ€™s car when the accused was never charged with causing damage to third party property but only for injuring the passenger. And although he claimed damages totalling â‚¬1700, Bugeja was never even formally identified in the court records. In light of such evidence and the circumstances of the case, the court cleared Gatt of the other charges whilst conditionally discharging him for 40 months over those charges he pleaded guilty to. When meting out punishment, the court took into consideration Gattâ€™s criminal record and the fact that the case had â€œinexplicablyâ€ dragged on for 17 years. The court also imposed a three-month driving ban.",30/12/2024,2006-12-17 00:00:00,triq il-mithna,qormi,Grievious,Unknown,Unknown,1,Car,not injured,Unknown,M,0,Car,,,,,,,,,,,20061217,Grievious,1,qormi,triq il-mithna,night,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,1,0,1,2,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,True,False,False,False,35.8830183,14.4734016,secondary,False,False,False,True,False,False,Central,True,False,False,False,False
article_2101.0,Driver jailed for four years for killing passenger in 2017 car crash,"A 48-year-old man has been jailed for four years for causing the death of a passenger in his car during a collision in August 2017. St Paulâ€™s Bay resident Godfrey Gambin was charged with the involuntary homicide of Jane Mary Turner, 45. He was also accused of causing involuntary bodily harm on another driver, causing damages to the other car and violating traffic rules. Police sergeant Denise Camilleri told the court that she was stationed at Mosta Police Station on August 20 2017 when she got the call about a collision on Triq Sir Temi Zammit in MÄ¡arr. The sergeant went on site and found Gambinâ€™s car had overturned, the driver was standing outside and had blood over him. Turner, who was inside Gambinâ€™s car, died on site. The other vehicle was on the pavement in the opposite direction. Gambin was hospitalised and was in intensive care for some time. The other driver told the court that he was going to GÄ§adira and was driving towards MÄ¡arr when he saw an oncoming car coming in the opposite direction in his lane. He had no time to avoid the collision and Gambin crashed his vehicle into the manâ€™s car.  The vehicle spun twice before ending up on the pavement. The windscreen shattered. The driver recalled that when he got out of his car, he found Gambinâ€™s car overturned and the female passenger dead on site. The court, presided over by magistrate Caroline Farrugia Frendo, found Gambin guilty and jailed him for four years. He was fined â‚¬11,600 and his driving licence was suspended for three months as from 2 April 2025. Gambin was also ordered to pay â‚¬2,975.91 in court expenses.

article_353524.0,Elderly man acquitted of traffic fatality as victim is blamed,"A man has been acquitted of causing the death of a pedestrian in Paola in 2018 after finding that the victim caused the incident through negligence and the motorist could do nothing about it. The accident happened at Triq Wied Bladun on May 13, 2018. George Glanville, now 83, from Fgura was accused of having caused the death of his friend, William Cocker. The court heard that on that day, Glanville was driving his Kia Rio on a clear road. The traffic light was green. Behind him a man rode a motorcycle accompanied by a passenger. Cocker suddenly emerged from behind a wall and attempted to cross the road straight in front of Glanvilleâ€™s car. Glanville told the police he was driving at 40-50 km/hr and stopped the vehicle immediately the accident happened. He got out of his car and spoke to Cocker who was still responsive. He only left the scene after the police allowed him to. Glanville told the police that he was sorry for what had happened, since Cocker was his friend and he had known him for a long time. He also kept visiting Cocker in hospital every two days until his death on May 31. Â  The motorcyclist who had been following Glanville testified that Cocker just crossed the road suddenly. Glanville hit the pedestrian and stopped the car immediately. The man recalled assisting the driver and the victim, who were two elderly men and knew each other. Another eyewitness said that the pedestrian was crossing on the pedestrian crossing when the lights were green for vehicles. Superintendent Hubert Cini testified that Cockerâ€™s injuries were certified as grievous; however, he was not seen at risk of dying at the time. A post-mortem investigation determined, however, that Cockerâ€™s death was a result of the incident. In their submissions on punishment, the prosecution said the charges were issued after the post-mortem examination showed that the victimâ€™s death was caused by the incident. It also argued that while the pedestrian crossed when the lights were green for vehicles, the driver failed to keep a proper lookout. The defence countered that the victim crossed the road without proper look-out when he should not have even crossed. The driver had no time to react. The court referred to the eyewitnesses who testified how Cocker just crossed the road without waiting for the red lights for vehicles. From their testimony, it emerged that the accused could not reasonably have avoided the incident. The court said that it was convinced that the accused was driving responsibly. The evidence showed that the victim had been negligent in this case and that it led to the unfortunate incident. â€œFor this reason, one cannot say that the accused did not keep a proper look out since the victimâ€™s action was unpredictable and there was nothing that the accused could have done to avoid the incident,â€ Magistrate Nadine Sant Lia observed. The court ruled that the incident was caused by Cockerâ€™s imprudence, which created an unpredictable emergency that made it impossible and unreasonable for the accused to take timely action and avoid the incident. Glanville was acquitted of having caused Cockerâ€™s death through negligent driving. Magistrate Nadine Sant Lia presided over the case.

article_1352.0,"Motorcyclist injured in pothole incident awarded â‚¬74,000","A 39-year-old Turkish national has been awarded over â‚¬74,000 in damages following an accident in SiÄ¡Ä¡iewi which left him suffering from a permanent disability. The man was driving his Piaggio Vespa along Triq GÄ§ar Lapsi on May 2, 2020, when he stumbled into a pothole, lost his balance and fell off the motorcycle. He was taken to Mater Dei Hospital where he was certified with grievous injuries. Following the incident, the man returned to Turkey since he needed treatment, and the coronavirus pandemic had hit. He also underwent several surgical interventions. As a result of the incident, he sustained permanent disability, which harmed his quality of life. The man eventually returned to Malta. Through his lawyers, he filed an application before the First Hall of the Civil Court, suing the SiÄ¡Ä¡iewi Local Council and Infrastructure Malta. He requested the court to hold both responsible for the incident and order them to pay him damages. Both Infrastructure Malta and the SiÄ¡Ä¡iewi local council argued that they were not suited, with the road agency arguing that the council was responsible for maintaining the road, while the local council argued that it was in the hands of the agency. In court, the man testified that as he was driving along Triq GÄ§ar Lapsi, direction towards Dingli cliffs, a few meters after he turned the corner, the condition of the road changed dramatically. Who is responsible for the road? He described how the road level went down by a few metres before he drove into a pothole. Moreover, there were no signs that the road surface would deteriorate, and the man said he had no reason to believe that the road surface would change in such a manner. John Fenech from Elles Urban Services Ltd â€“ a company engaged by the council to maintain the roads â€“ acknowledged that the road was in a state of disrepair and it had to be resurfaced. He also testified that the damage to the road was primarily attributable to the frequent passage of heavy vehicles in the service of nearby quarries. He added that the road was not built to take the weight of the vehicles. A police constable similarly testified that the road was in a bad state, noting that there were several cracks in the asphalt and potholes. In establishing who was responsible for the road, the court heard architect David Vassallo from Infrastructure Malta. The witness said the road fell under the responsibility of the local council, however, the road agency intervened and issued an emergency allocation to contractor Philip Agius and Sons for â‚¬1.5 million, excluding VAT, in December 2020. The councilâ€™s executive secretary, Ritianne Giorgino, told the court that while it was within the councilâ€™s boundary, the local council is responsible for maintenance or patching works, while resurfacing falls under the responsibility of the local government. Referring to the mayorâ€™s affidavit, the court observed that while it was outlined that the council has several structures to monitor and ascertain that roads are kept in a good state of repair, this was not the case and notwithstanding the â€œlayers of surveillance adopted by the Council, somewhere down the line, somebody is not doing his job properly or else the technical operandi is not functioning."" The court reminded how the road is used by heavy vehicles and therefore, the road should have been monitored more closely and frequently. It also observed that it was only after the plaintiff was injured that the road was properly repaired. The court concluded that the council was wholly to blame for the accident.Â  When it came to calculating damages, it took into consideration that 21 months after the accident, the manâ€™s radial nerve did not make a full recovery, and this was most likely improbable. It also took into consideration the court-appointed expertâ€™s observations on the fracture of the distal tibia, which involved an articular surface of the ankle joint and will inevitably lead to arthritic change. The motorcyclist also ended up with substantial amounts of metal implants attached to the humerus and tibia. These foreign bodies provide a slightly increased risk of bone infection during bacetermia, according to the expert. After calculating the damages, the court declared the SiÄ¡Ä¡iewi local council responsible for the incident and ordered it to pay the man â‚¬74,873. Mr Justice Toni Abela presided over the court.

In February 2022, 28-year-old Nepali delivery driver Ajay Shrestha died when a truck overturned on Marsaâ€™s Aldo Moro Road. The vehicle ploughed into a lamppost before spilling its load of scrap metal onto oncoming traffic, fatally crushing Shrestha. Shrestha, known to friends as â€˜AJâ€™, had moved to Malta from Nepal in 2018 in search of work. Just a week before the accident, he had celebrated his 28th birthday. â€œIt has been three years now since my brotherâ€™s death, and nothing has happened. Nobody has contacted me,â€ Ajayâ€™s older brother, Anil, told Times of Malta.  Anil recalled how his sibling always had a smile on his face and, during his time in Malta, made a lot of friends. â€œHe was very passionate about sport, he played cricket back at home and loved to play music. He was never angry with anyone and was just a very good person.â€ He said the two were always together from childhood until the fatal accident changed that. â€œAll my family wants is justice for Ajay.

article_3861.0,Mother calls for stricter penalties after sonâ€™s road death,"The mother of a 21-year-old man who died in a traffic accident two years ago believes the courts are too lenient in suspending the licences of drivers responsible for serious or fatal collisions. Fiona Laferlaâ€™s son, Ben, was a passenger in a rental car driven by his friend, Maxime Asacha Muehlematter, when it crashed into a wall on Triq il-Madliena in Swieqi. Last month, Muehlematter received a suspended jail sentence and a one-year driving ban after admitting to involuntarily causing Benâ€™s death on September 24, 2022. Maltese traffic regulations stipulate a minimum driving ban of six months to a year, with courts having discretion over the final length based on the specific circumstances.  Lingering questions In court, it emerged that the front seatbelts were elongated but those at the back were stiff, indicating Ben and Flo had not been wearing them. After the crash, first aiders found Ben outside the car. A passer-by pulled him out to try to help. Maxâ€™s 17-year-old girlfriend initially claimed she was driving. She later admitted she lied, thinking her age would protect her from charges. She received a conditional discharge. A bottle of rum and another bottle of alcohol was found in the car, leading to public assumptions about the groupâ€™s behaviour. Fiona derides the â€œcallous commentsâ€ and clarifies that Ben had had the bottle of rum for weeks. Fiona remains unconvinced about the reported speed of 35km/hr, noting that Benâ€™s injuries seemed too severe. â€œYou know how many times my sister and I tried taking a sudden break at that speed to try to understand? I know that stupid things happen. In this case, there was a wall. But there are still questions.â€ The mother says the car safety element was never explored during the court case. â€œThere is always a fault â€“ but there are other things to consider that go beyond the driver: is the car properly maintained? Is the road too dark?â€ Fiona was hoping the court case would give her the answers. It did not, and she found it painful when a defence lawyer attempted to discredit Ben and Flo, even though they were sitting at the back. In the end, following a change of lawyer, Max admitted to causing Benâ€™s death. The prosecution withdrew charges relating to reckless and negligent driving as well as driving under the influence, because there was no material evidence that could lead to a conviction. â€œI wasnâ€™t hoping Max goes to prison because I wasnâ€™t out for vengeance. I donâ€™t want to persecute the boy. Ben loved him. He was his friend. That was meant to be down the road and coming back. You donâ€™t think itâ€™s going to happen to youâ€¦ Just because Ben is not here doesnâ€™t mean Max cannot have a life.â€ And now, Fiona says, her mission is to keep Benâ€™s memory alive.

St Paulâ€™s Bay resident Jithu James, 32, was accused of driving a vehicle in a dangerous, negligent and reckless manner and grievously injuring a pedestrian in an incident that occurred in October 2023. A motorist who was on his way home from work at the time of incident, explained he had been waiting for pedestrians to cross a pelican crossing on December 13 Road when he saw a vehicle being driven at an â€œabnormalâ€ speed. The speeding vehicle crashed into the witnessâ€™ car, which in turn hit a pedestrian using the crossing. The witness exited his vehicle, called the emergency services and went to assist a woman who was lying on the ground. In his testimony, he recalled that she was not in a â€œgoodâ€ state. Under cross-examination he confirmed he had stopped but not pulled up his handbrake. He also confirmed he had not been charged in connection with the incident. Another witness, who had been using the crossing at the time of the incident, explained he had been crossing the road with his dog, with a woman walking next to him. Two cars had been waiting for pedestrians to finish using the crossing, he recalled, when a third car crashed into one of the stationary cars. He added that his dog lost a tooth in the crash. The man remained with the woman until the ambulance came. The court in its considerations held that James failed to maintain a proper lookout while driving, especially when approaching a pedestrian crossing. The man was fined â‚¬4,000 and had 10 points knocked off his licence. He was disqualified from holding a driving licence for three months.

We are completely left in the dark.â€  While many commenters expressed solidarity with the father and others speculated that achieving justice would be a long and thankless journey that may not even be successful, one voice of encouragement stood out from the rest.Â  Bonnici urged Neidhardt not to give in to negativity and keep fighting to seek the truth about his son's death.Â  ""Don't give up on getting justice for your son!

article_495942.0,Traffic collision case collapses over identification failure and police error,"A St Paulâ€™s Bay man accused of causing a traffic collision has been acquitted after the alleged victim failed to identify him in court and police failed to follow proper procedures during the investigation. Dennis Attard, 49, of Triq l-Imsida, Santa Venera, faced five charges stemming from a collision on 23 September 2024 in Triq Censu Tabone, St Paulâ€™s Bay, including reckless driving, causing involuntary damage, driving without a licence, driving an unlicensed vehicle, and driving without insurance. The case centred on a collision between Attardâ€™s vehicle and a motorcycle ridden by Marland Herman Jones. Jones told the court he was riding down a narrow street when a car â€œjust kind of jumped inâ€ and pulled out in front of him. â€œI braked as hard as I could but I hit the I believe his door or the front right quarter panel,â€ he testified, adding that he â€œjust kind of fell over and jumped up cursing.â€ Jones explained that the driver claimed he had to leave urgently because â€œhis daughter was giving birth.â€ They exchanged phone numbers via WhatsApp, but when Jones attempted to contact him, he received no response despite seeing the messages had been viewed. â€œI tried to contact him again, no answer.

However, when asked to identify the accused in court, Jones admitted: â€œActually at at this date I canâ€™t recognize him in court, if this is the gentleman, I donâ€™t quite recognize him, I have to be honest.â€ He explained he had identified someone at the police station â€œover 8 months agoâ€ but â€œcouldnâ€™t tell you now.â€ The defence suggested Jones had hit the car from behind, but Jones firmly rejected this, stating repeatedly: â€œThatâ€™d be completely incorrectâ€ and â€œThatâ€™d be incredibly incorrect.â€ Magistrate Yana Micallef Stafrace dismissed all charges on Monday, ruling that Jones â€œdid not recognise the accused in Courtâ€ and noting his claimed identification at the police station â€œdoes not result from the police affidavit.â€ Moreover, the court found that â€œon the day of the collision the right to silence was not administered to the accused as required by law.â€ Court therefore concluded that â€œthe evidence does not provide beyond reasonable doubt all the elements of the crime, and therefore the imputations have not been proven to the degree required in the criminal field.â€ Attard chose not to testify and was acquitted of all charges.",06/10/2025,2024-09-23 00:00:00,triq censu tabone,st pauls bay,not injured,49,M,0,Car,not injured,none,M,0,Motorbike,,,,,,,,,,,20240923,not injured,0,san pawl il bahar,triq censu tabone,night,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,0,0,1,0,0,True,False,False,2,0,0,2,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,False,False,False,True,35.94988,14.40962,residential,False,False,True,False,False,False,Northern,False,False,True,False,False
article_4208.0,Driver stuck in traffic says speeding LESA car shattered his mirror,"A motorist claims his car mirror was shattered by a speeding LESA vehicle that failed to stop after hitting his car while he was stuck in traffic. Frank Xerri De Caro, 78, was driving his Toyota Yaris home after a meeting on Wednesday around 5pm when the accident occurred on the Regional Road, near the St Julianâ€™s tunnels. Heavy traffic had brought vehicles to a near standstill, leaving little room for manoeuvring. As he approached the tunnels next to St Clareâ€™s Convent, Xerri De Caro said he noticed what he then believed to be a police car with sirens blaring in the distance. Attempting to give way, he moved his car closer to the side of the road. â€œI could tell the car was coming quite close to me but I couldnâ€™t move anymore as I didnâ€™t have more space to,â€ he explained. Moments later, he said a speeding LESA vehicle struck his right-hand side mirror, shattering it into pieces on the ground. Xerri De Caro described feeling both shocked and frustrated, notably when the car continued without stopping to assess the situation. â€œI was shocked at that moment but more so frustrated afterwards,â€ he said, explaining that he had to spend â‚¬300 to repair the damage. Xerri De Caro, who shared his experience on social media, initially said his mirror was destroyed by a police car.Â After filing a police report and speaking with the police on Thursday morning, he noticed he made a mistake and said that it had been a LESA car that hit his mirror.Â  He took to social media once again to praise the police for their efficient work and thanked them for their assistance.Â  LESA responded to the matter in question by saying, ""LESA has received no communication regarding this matter from the injured party prior to this media question."" They continued, "" LESA invites the injured party to provide all relevant information so that the necessary checks can be made, in accordance with the usual procedure.""",07/12/2024,2024-12-04 17:00:00,regional road,st julian's,not injured,78,M,0,Car,not injured,Unknown,Unknown,0,Car,,,,,,,,,,,20241204,not injured,0,st julian,regional road,afternoon,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,1,True,False,True,1,0,1,2,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,False,False,False,True,35.9034355,14.4867323,trunk,False,False,False,False,False,True,Northern,False,False,True,False,False

article_4024.0,â€˜Iâ€™m tired of going to friendsâ€™ funeralsâ€™: bikers' anger after skip crash death,"The president of a motorcycle advocacy group has expressed his anger at the perceived negligence of the authorities, which he says led to the death of a biker last week. Dieter Vink, 54, died last Friday, two days after crashing his motorcycle into a skip positioned on the final curve of the St Paulâ€™s Bay bypass before the Xemxija roundabout.  â€œIâ€™m sick of going to funerals. It feels like our lives are cheap,â€ Galea said, mentioning the deaths of Johanna Boni, after being hit by a truck in 2015, and Marie Claire Lombardi, who lost control of her bike after it skidded on olives spilled onto the road in 2022. Speaking about the experience of riding a motorcycle more generally, Galea said it had become more dangerous to drive on Maltaâ€™s roads over the past four or five years. â€œI think itâ€™s because drivers are frustrated by the ever-increasing traffic, which in turn leads them to drive in an impatient and careless manner. Right now, the situation feels like itâ€™s beyond repair,â€ he said. Aldo Overend, a committee member of the NGO, echoed Galeaâ€™s sentiments.Â  â€œWe just hope this accident will lead to action because we canâ€™t go on like this,"" he said. ""While riding, I feel like I constantly have to dodge heavy vehicles, construction materials, fresh concrete and water leaking from bowsers, as well as reckless car drivers not taking us into account."" Official data shows almost 40 per cent of all road traffic casualties involve motorcyclists.Â  Vinkâ€™s family and friends have vowed to get justice for his death and are seeking legal advice. A GoFundMe page has been set up to raise funds to cover funeral and legal expenses, along with a fundraising bike ride planned for December 28, starting at Mater Dei Hospital and ending at Vinkâ€™s second home, The Pitstop in Xemxija.",17/12/2024,2024-12-11 17:00:00,st pauls bay bypass,st pauls bay,Fatal,54,M,1,Motorbike,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20241211,Fatal,1,san pawl il bahar,xemxija bypass,afternoon,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,0,0,0,1,0,True,False,False,1,0,0,1,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,False,False,False,True,35.9469478,14.3994613,trunk,False,False,False,False,False,True,Northern,False,False,True,False,False

His parents and girlfriend were in shock when they learned about the accident and are determined to get justice for him. From debris left on the scene, the van appears to be a Citroen Berlingo.

article_2452.0,"Driver injured after his truck overturns in Rabat, load spilled across road","Updated: 3.30pm A truck driver was grievously injured when his vehicle overturned, spilling an entire load of construction sand across the road near Mdina on Friday morning. The accident happened on Triq Buqana in Rabat at around 10am. The spillage caused both carriageways of the main road leading to MÄ¡arr to be closed to traffic. The driver of the DAC truck - a 35-year-old man from Marsascala - was taken to hospital by ambulance.Â  In a Facebook post, Transport Malta announced it had closed the road in both directions until the vehicle and the sand were cleared away.  ROTA urges segregation of high-speed traffic, bicyclesÂ  In a statement on Friday afternoon, bicycle advocacy group ROTA said the crash flagged the urgent need forÂ better road safety measures, particularly for bicycle users. The truck, the NGO said, ended up within the bicycle lane, where, had there been a bicycle user, they could have been fatally injured. ""The current road design offers no protection for cyclists, and this tragic event highlights the pressing need for proper segregation between high-speed traffic and vulnerable road users, particularly those on bicycles,"" ROTA said. The need for protected bicycle lanes is not just a local issue - the matter has also been flagged in international road safety guidelines such as the CROW guidelines. These guidelines emphasise the importance of segregation in high-speed areas and the need for roads that are forgiving of human error, the group noted. ""In simple terms, we must ensure that the consequences of mistakes â€“ whether made by a driver or a cyclist â€“ are not fatal. Sadly, Malta is still without a legally binding national cycling policy that will outline clear standards for the design and implementation of safe and effective bicycle lanes. ""We cannot allow cyclists to be subjected to what is, at best, a makeshift effort that often amounts to nothing more than a splash of green paint and some rumble strips. It is not enough. Bicycle lanes need to be designed to protect cyclists â€“ physically separated from traffic in high-speed areas, with sufficient space and barriers to prevent accidents.""",14/03/2025,2025-03-14 10:00:00,triq buqana,rabat,Grievious,35,M,1,Van,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20250314,Grievious,1,rabat,triq buqana,morning,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,0,0,1,0,0,True,False,False,1,0,0,1,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,False,False,True,35.8919893,14.4089334,primary,False,True,False,False,False,False,Central,True,False,False,False,False

Transport Malta is monitoring the situation and will provide updates as soon as the road is reopened to traffic.â€  The situation caused significant congestion throughout the area.

article_894.0,"Share first, think later: When 'citizen journalism' crosses ethical lines","Photographing and sharing images of tragic accidents on social media is â€œcitizen journalism at its worstâ€ and highlights the urgent need to focus on digital education across the nation, according to experts in communication and human behaviour. The issue came to light once again following a recent fatal traffic accident in which a motorcyclist died on the spot. After the accident, graphic photos were shared extensively via WhatsApp. This had also happened some months ago when footage of another fatal accident, that involved a car losing control, made the rounds on social media. Prof. Anton Grech, clinical chairman of Mental Health Services, explained that while human curiosity in the case of unusual or dramatic situations is normal â€“ a phenomenon known as rubbernecking â€“ social media amplified this. These actions â€“ of taking and sharing images of tragic situations â€“ were a reflection of a larger situation, he said. Before social media existed there were â€˜celebritiesâ€™ and â€˜spectatorsâ€™. Social media brought with it a shift in which many people wanted to be protagonists. This was happening in a virtual environment that is saturated with content and, in which, in order to be seen and stand out, the content has to be attention-grabbing. â€œIn parallel with this, we are losing respect for the society around us. We saw this in a recent case when a man was threatening to jump off the Valletta bastions,â€ he said, referring to the 2021 case when onlookers urged a man to jump from the edge of a Valletta bastion, with many filming the ordeal. â€œMany people seize all opportunities to gain this recognition without respect for others,â€ he said, adding that there was an urgent need to educate people on this matter. Prof. Brenda Murphy, a media and gender expert and founder of NGO Mediating Women, agreed that there was the urgent need for more media education â€“ in schools and beyond â€“ through curriculum and public campaigns. â€œThis is a public education issue â€“ we need to re-establish digital boundaries. We need to remind people that our duty of care doesnâ€™t disappear when we are online,â€ she said. Such cases, she said, were â€œcitizen journalism at its worstâ€ as they offered â€œa great snapshot of the widening gaps in â€˜news productionâ€™â€. â€œJournalists and editors are trained, educated, bound by professional regulation â€“ citizens operate withoutÂ any of these guardrails. While citizen journalism was lauded as a great liberator for information â€“ this is an example of a great backfire,â€ she said. A deeply problematic phenomenon Murphy explained that the sharing of such images was a â€œdeeply problematic phenomenonâ€ that reflects multiple pressures converging at the moment. From a digital culture perspective, she said, we are living in a world where everything is documented, and the boundary between private and public is becoming increasingly eroded. â€œIn the case of tragic moments, there seems to be an underlying belief that if something shocking happens, it should be recorded and shared. The algorithms that drive social media amplify this. They reward visibility, and sadly that includes tragic events,â€ she said. Then there was the conversation on media ethics. Â â€œWe may have the capacity to capture something digitally, but that doesnâ€™t mean we should. Sharing media content has become so normalised it completely breaches the private-public boundary. We need to be mindful that sharing a traumatic event compounds trauma â€“ not just for the family and friends but the wider community is impacted too. We cannot justify this â€˜norm driftâ€™ by saying â€˜itâ€™s already out there, so itâ€™s ok to repostâ€™,â€ she said.",29/05/2025,2025-05-27 12:30:00,xemxija bypass,xemxija,Fatal,35,M,1,Motorbike,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20250527,Fatal,1,xemxija,xemxija bypass,afternoon,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,0,0,1,0,0,True,False,False,1,0,0,1,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,False,False,False,True,35.9469478,14.3994613,trunk,False,False,False,False,False,True,Northern,False,False,True,False,False

article_297729.0,Rider injured in hit-and-run is told tunnel cameras donâ€™t work,"A scooter rider injured in a hit-and-run crash in the Regional Road tunnels earlier this month is struggling to track down the driver, after being told that none of the tunnel cameras work. Giuseppe Di Dio, a 22-year-old Sicilian who works as a DJ and event organiser, was riding his Vespa 300 on July 2 at around 12.30pm when he was hit. As he entered the tunnel heading towards Swieqi, he says a van crossed into his lane, cut him off and crashed into him, knocking him off his Vespa. â€œI feel super lucky to tell the story. It hurt a lot. When I was on the floor, I could feel my burns,â€ he told Times of Malta. Shocked by the impact, Di Dio said he could not identify the van but recalled opening his eyes to see the driver standing over him. According to Di Dio, the man looked South Asian and was wearing a blue shirt. He believes he was driving a delivery van but is unsure which company the van belonged to. â€œHe came over, checked I was alive, told me nothing and rushed off,â€ he said. â€œI know if I saw him, I would recognise him.â€ Thankfully, other drivers stopped to help Di Dio. He was taken to Mater Dei Hospital, where he said he had to wait between six to seven hours before being seen. â€œThat was horrible. I couldnâ€™t take it anymore and began to scream out in pain, and only then did they see me,â€ he said. He was initially told he had minor injuries and was prescribed painkillers. But after several days, his wounds became increasingly painful and doctors at Saint James Hospital later confirmed they were infected. Alongside the physical injuries, Di Dio said his motorbike was damaged and he incurred around â‚¬4,000 in expenses for medical treatment, medications, transport and missed work. â€œI want a refund for the damages but the most important thing is I want to find out who hit me to avoid future accidents,â€ he said.  After being treated, Di Dio filed a police report. He hoped CCTV footage from the tunnel would help identify the van. But he said police informed him that the security cameras inside the Taâ€™ Giorni tunnels do not work. â€œItâ€™s insane. The policeman told me that none of the cameras they have for the tunnels work,â€ he said. â€œI told them that it is impossible but they told me again that none of them work.â€ In 2020, the government launched a â‚¬10 million project to upgrade Maltaâ€™s major tunnels, including Taâ€™ Giorni, which included the installation of security cameras. When asked if the cameras were working on the day of the incident, the transport ministry said: â€œThe Traffic Control Centre did not have CCTV coverage in the mentioned area on the 2nd of July 2025.â€ The ministry did not answer questions about whether the cameras are operational. Police confirmed that a report on the accident had been filed and investigations are ongoing. In 2022, a Transport Malta spokesperson told Times of Malta that tunnel cameras were linked to the authorityâ€™s traffic control centre, and used for both congestion monitoring and automatic incident detection.",20/07/2025,2025-07-02 12:30:00,ta' giorni tunnels,swieqi,Serious,22,M,1,Scooter,Serious,none,M,1,Van,,,,,,,,,,,20250702,Serious,2,swieqi,ta' giorni tunnels,afternoon,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,2,0,0,2,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,False,False,True,False,35.89736,14.49371,primary,False,True,False,False,False,False,Northern,False,False,True,False,False

article_490183.0,Breathalyser showed motorist in fatal Valletta crash was five times over limit,"A breathalyser test on Benjamin Chetcuti, the driver involved in last month's fatal crash in Valletta showed him to be some five times above the legal limit, a court heard on Tuesday. The test returned a reading of 139.2 Î¼g/100ml (microgrammes of alcohol per 100 ml) of breath or about five times the legal limit, Superintendent Nicholas Vella said at the compilation of evidence against Chetcuti, an AFM soldier arraigned last month. He stands accused of the involuntary homicide of Mildred Azzopardi, driving under the influence and grievously injuring Azzopardi's husband through negligence. He denies the charges. Mildred Azzopardi, 62, from Ä¦amrun, a mother of four, died at the scene on July 27 when Chetcuti's car ploughed into her car as she put items in the boot. The 23-year-old accused joined the AFM as a recruit in January and on June 10 had his passing out ceremony and was confirmed as a gunner. He was posted to the Maritime Squadron on July 1. Police superintendent Nicholas Vella from the Road Policing Unit testified on how the accident happened at Xatt il-Barrieri, where the Azzopardis had earlier been fishing. Vella played out footage from ten CCTV cameras, explaining that the accused drove around Fort St Elmo initially at 36km/hr. His Subaru Impresa could then be seen at a speed of 246.33/m in nine seconds, meaning an average speed of 98 km/hr. The superintendent said Alfred Azzopardi, the victim's husband, was already in their Ford Fiesta while Mildred was putting some stuff away in the boot when the crash took place. CCTV footage taken from the offices of shipping companies in the area showed the Subaru Impresa arriving at a high speed before the driver lost control and it swerved, hitting Mildred Azzopardi' car first. Azzopardi died on the spot.  Medicolegal expert Mario Scerri testified that Mildred Azzopardi sustained several bone fractures and internal haemorrhage. Her husband sufferedÂ  grievous injuries and was in intensive care for a while. He added that Chetcuti tested negative for drugs. His urine sample was sent to another expert for further testing. Medicolegal experts Ali Sarfraz and David Pisani took the witness stand and testified jointly on the findings of the post-mortem examination which showed that Mildred Azzopardi suffered multiple injuries. An eyewitness also took the stand on Tuesday morning. Reeves Cini explained that at the time of the incident he was at the nearby Siege Bell Memorial. â€œWhen I arrived on site I found Benjamin,â€ the witness said, clarifying that he knew the accused from the time the latter worked in Valletta. The road had already been closed. The witness said he feared the worst since his grandfather owned a boathouse in the area. He asked Chectuti if he wanted something to drink, and ran up to his home and got him a soft drink from the fridge. Chetcuti told him: â€œI was coming from Pixxkerija (fishmarket) side when I lost control of the vehicle and crashed into the cars.â€",12/08/2025,2025-07-27 22:00:00,ta' liesse,valletta,Fatal,23,M,1,Car,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20250727,Fatal,1,valletta,liesse hill,late_evening,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,1,0,0,1,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,True,False,True,False,35.8953521,14.5135698,residential,False,False,True,False,False,False,Southern Harbour,False,False,False,False,True

article_490697.0,"Magistrate urges random alcohol, drug tests after fatal biker crash","A magistrate has called for random roadside alcohol and drug testing of drivers, after a fatal Senglea motorcycle crash revealed the rider had cocaine in his system. Magistrate Joe Mifsud made the recommendation following a magisterial inquiry into the June accident on Triq ix-Xatt Juan B. Azopardo. The 43-year-old motorcyclist lost control, struck a bollard and was killed on the spot. No one else was injured. Toxicology tests conducted during the autopsy found traces of cocaine in his system. In his concluding remarks, Mifsud said that â€œwhile it seems that disciplinary measures have started being taken while driving, enforcement needs to increase and officials should be conscious of their role in protecting livesâ€. He stressed that while discipline has never killed anyone, substance abuse has, with the victims sometimes being innocent, law-abiding citizens who suffer due to the abuse of others. The magistrate urged better coordination between the authorities and constant, rather than sporadic, law enforcement presence on the roads. He referred to a 2023 position paper co-written by NGO Doctors For Road Safety, the Maltese Association of Psychiatry and the Foundation for Welfare Services on drug-driving under the influence of psychoactive drugs.  The paper states that â€œthe use of psychoactive drugs can result in impaired driving skills, leading to an increased risk of road traffic crashes. â€œIt is important to note that the most common psychoactive drugs involved in driving crashes are often taken for recreational purposes, although prescription drugs such as benzodiazepines and opioids can also impair driving skills.â€ Mifsud endorsed each of the paperâ€™s eight recommendations, including the introduction of a legal framework to enable random drug testing for psychoactive substances, as well as the random screening of professional drivers, such as taxi, school bus, coach and heavy machinery drivers. The paper also called for the establishment of clear guidelines regarding acceptable substance levels in the body while driving, and the review and updating of existing legislation to include penalties for the combined use of drugs and alcohol to reflect the increased risk to road safety. Many European countries allow random or targeted random roadside testing for alcohol or drugs. In the UK, Germany and Malta, the police need â€œreasonable suspicionâ€ to conduct tests. The Maltese magistrateâ€™s call comes amid a spate of serious road accidents in recent weeks, several linked to drink-driving. In July, AFM soldier Benjamin Chetcuti was allegedly five times over the alcohol limit when his car hit 62-year-old Mildred Azzopardi in Valletta, killing her and injuring her husband. The test returned a positive result of 139.2 Î¼g/100ml when the legal limit is 22micrograms. On August 10, food courier Khim Bahadur Pun, 42, from Nepal, was killed when his motorcycle was hit by a car driven by a 17-year-old in Santa Venera. The youth fled the scene but was arrested five hours later. Police said a breathalyser test found he was over the legal alcohol limit. And earlier this month, a taxi crashed into a hair salon in Santa Venera. The owner, who was outside at the time, was unhurt. Tests showed the driverâ€™s alcohol level exceeded 100mg.",18/08/2025,2025-08-18 00:00:00,triq ix-xatt juan b. azopardo,senglea,Fatal,43,none,0,Motorbike,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20250818,Fatal,0,isla,triq ix-xatt juan b azopardo,night,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,0,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,0,0,1,1,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,35.88794,14.51784,secondary,False,False,False,True,False,False,Southern Harbour,False,False,False,False,True

article_491118.0,Concrete action urged for road safety,"The Nationalist Party on Thursday called for â€œconcrete actionâ€ to address road safety in Malta as an emergency doctor slammed the situation as ""unacceptable"". The statements came in the wake of another accident caused by drink-driving when a car, driven by a Brazilian man, crashed head on into an oncoming bus in the opposite lane on Tower Road in Sliema. The car driver was four times over the alcohol limit.Â  Michael Spiteri, who was attending to the first call out of the day at just before 6am on Thursday in the wake of the Sliema accident, warned this could ""have ended in tragedy"". â€œIrresponsible drivers are putting innocent lives at risk. It is obvious that some are refusing to learn, so the only way forward is random and frequent checks, harsh penalties, and highly visible enforcement to deter this reckless behaviour. This country should act to reduce preventable injuries and deaths,â€ Spiteri said. In a number of proposals to address the issue, the Opposition insisted on â€œzero toleranceâ€ for accidents caused by drivers who are found to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, stronger law enforcement, harsher penalties and the introduction of a â€œnew specific criminal offenceâ€ for causing death or grievous bodily harm due to gross negligence, recklessness and/or dangerous driving. This offence would carry a minimum penalty of five yearsâ€™ effective imprisonment, rising up to life imprisonment in cases with aggravating factors, the PN said. Currently, the Police Force has 18 breathalysers, while LESA has five breathalyser kits, all of which only detect alcohol. The PN said the number of road-testing devices â€œmust be increasedâ€ and kits that detect drugs should be added. â€œThis is a real and serious problem on our roads,â€ the PN said. They also highlighted the shortage of staff allocated in the police traffic section and urged for greater investment in the police force, the traffic section and the authorities responsible for road enforcement.

article_496206.0,Watch: Traffic accident caught live on air during live Transport Malta interview,"Maltaâ€™s traffic woes were brought home to TV viewers live on air after a minor accident was caught on camera during a roadside TVM interview with a Transport Malta official. The footage shows a silver vehicle crashing into the back of a red car in front as the latter stops at a Paola roundabout, as Transport Maltaâ€™s (TM) deputy head of enforcement Jean Claude Attard is interviewed in the foreground live onÂ TVM. Attard appears startled at the sound of the accident before looking around to the scene of the bumper-to-bumper in the background, while the presenter continues speaking. The accident occurred just moments after the presenter said the pair were â€œhere in the early hours of the morning, when traffic seems to be at its peak â€“ which is normal for the countryâ€.  Reacting to the incident, Attard tells the presenter: â€œAs you can see, these things happen on the go, as behind us, we have a bumper-to-bumper which can take a while to clear the vehicles from the streetâ€. He added that TM officials would â€œplace markers on the ground of where the crash happened to move the cars as fast as possibleâ€ in addition to their duties directing traffic at what he described as â€œone of the busiest junctions in the southâ€. TM officials can be seen attending the scene shortly after the incident occurs. Thursdayâ€™s on-air accident comes as Malta continues to battle perennial congestion and frustration on the roads. On Tuesday, gridlock was particularly bad across the country as Malta registered 23 collisions, 10 vehicle breakdowns and two separate spillages across the island during morning rush hour. Motorists reported spending more than double the usual time on their commutes, and many took to social media to express frustration, complaining about standstill traffic that stretched even onto non-arterial roads. The issue spilt over into parliamentary proceedings later that day when Opposition Leader Alex Borg quipped to Robert Abela that he was delayed because, due to not being escorted like the prime minister, he was stuck in traffic.",09/10/2025,2025-10-09 00:00:00,paola roundabout,paola,slight,none,none,0,Car,slight,none,none,0,Car,,,,,,,,,,,20251009,Slight,0,paola,paola roundabout,night,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,0,0,2,2,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,False,False,False,True,,,other,True,False,False,False,False,False,Southern Harbour,False,False,False,False,True
